Governance and sustainability,
"As an externally managed REIT, CIP has no staff and",
is solely a portfolio of assets. The REIT is managed by,
Centuria Capital Group and aligns itself to Centuria’s,
sustainability framework. A number of key CIP-specific,
ESG initiatives include:,
•  Targeting zero scope 2 emissions by 20281,
•  Continued partnership between CIP and Healthy Heads,
•  GRESB participation with results expected in September,
2025,
•  Targeting a portfolio-wide Green Star performance v2.0,
rating,
•  Developments underway target 5 star Green Star Design,
and As Built v1 ratings,
•  50% female representation on CPF2L’s Board,
Summary and outlook,
CIP is well positioned to harness the strong market,
fundamentals for Australian urban infill industrial,
"markets. Vacancy rates remain very low, while supply",
is constrained. Coupled with the ongoing industry,
"tailwinds, most notably population growth and increasing",
"e-commerce adoption, the outlook for growth over the",
medium term is compelling.,
CIP continues to generate strong income growth and,
"re-leasing spreads, maintaining significant under-renting",
that is yet to be realised. As CIP approaches a potentially,
"lower interest rate and debt cost environment, we expect",
this will begin to have a more meaningful impact on CIP’s,
earnings in the coming periods.,
"Yours sincerely,",
