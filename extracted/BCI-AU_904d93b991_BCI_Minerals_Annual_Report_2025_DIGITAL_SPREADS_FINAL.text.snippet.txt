Mardie village
Over 99 per cent of the energy required 
to produce salt and sulphate of potash at 
Mardie comes from the sun and wind.  
In FY25, BCI continued to take meaningful 
steps towards understanding and reducing 
the carbon footprint associated with the 
Mardie Operation. 
In October, BCI submitted its initial (FY24) 
emissions report to the Clean Energy 
Regulator in compliance with National 
Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER) 
requirements. BCI contributed 14,183 t 
CO2-e (Scope 1) and 53 t CO2-e (Scope 2) for 
FY24, which is below the NGER emissions 
reporting thresholds. Objective: Implement strategies to reduce the direct and indirect carbon 
emissions from BCI Minerals’ activities. Emissions and Climate 
Together, these activities reflect BCI’s 
commitment to embedding climate 
considerations into the way we design, 
build, and operate the Mardie Project.  
The Company’s focus remains on 
continuous improvement, transparency,  
and pragmatically preparing for a low-
carbon future.
