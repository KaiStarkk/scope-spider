=== Table 3 (page 43) ===
,,,A review from FY25 showed that the majority of our
TOTAL Energy Consumed,,,
,,,"Scope 1 emissions come from diesel consumption,"
,,,accounting for 73% of emissions. The estimated
"3,000,000",,,
,,,distribution of these emissions is 53% from stationary
,,,"sources (machinery and equipment), 31% from"
"2,500,000",,,transportation and 17% from power generation.
,,,"Additionally, natural gas contributes 26% of Scope 1"
,,,"emissions, used solely for power generation. We are"
"2,000,000",,,
,,,hopeful we can leverage the work done at the hybrid
,,,power project at Mt Magnet to date to continue our
"1,500,000",,,
,,,emission reduction trajectory.
,,,In order to prepare for AASB S2 climate-related
"1,000,000",,,
,,,"financial disclosure frameworks, we have engaged"
,,,a third-party to assess the controls and processes in
"500,000",,,place for recording our GHG emissions for reporting
,,,purposes. We are implementing recommendations
,,,provided in anticipation of the new regulations in the
,,,2026 financial year.

,,,Scope 3 Emissions
,,,Calculations
Total GHG Emissions,,,Scope 3 emissions encompass a broader range of
,,,greenhouse gas emissions that occur throughout the
"150,000",,,
,,,entire product life cycle. These are increasingly being
,,,used to understanding and assessing a company’s
,,,entire value chain emissions impact and identify areas
,,,"of high risk, and where a company has most opportunity"
"100,000",,,
,,,"to influence and impact the emissions of its suppliers,"
,,,customers and other value chain inputs. We engaged
,,,third-party consultants to provide a tool for the collection
,,,of Scope 3 data and calculations in FY25. This helped us
"50,000",,,
,,,gain insight into our carbon footprint beyond our direct
,,,operations (Scope 1) and indirect emissions from energy
,,,consumption (Scope 2) and become prepared for the
,,,"changes to the AASB S1 and S2 standards, which require"
FY25,FY24,FY23,more rigorous and detailed climate-related disclosures.
,,,"For FY25, we calculated our Scope 3 emissions footprint"
Total Scope 1 Emissions,,Total Scope 2 Emissions,"to be 166,131 tCO2-e. The following categories were"
,,,considered in our assessment:
