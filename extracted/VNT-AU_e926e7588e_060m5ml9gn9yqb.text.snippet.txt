Telecommunications and Transport. The full year benefit of new Telecommunications contracts , such 
as nbn’s fibre upgrade works , Telstra’s Intercity fibre build , as well as  the new Transurban contract in 
Transport have contributed to revenue growth of over 20% in both sectors.   
“We see significant future growth opportunity  across all four business sectors , underpinned by strong 
demand drivers and market  trends . We are confident  our strategy will continue to deliver  service 
excellence for our clients and long-term value for shareholders ,” said Dean .  
Safety and Sustainability  
Ventia’s TRIFR continued to improve , falling from  3.7 to 3.3 in FY23, an 11.3% reduction. Th ere were 
several new and innovative safety campaigns introduced in 2023 that have contributed to our safety 
performance . Some of these include our Elevate program (targeting leadership behaviours ), All Roads 
Lead  to Home (targeting driv er safety ) and a continued focus  on improving our safety indicato rs. 
Our commitment to sustainability is unwavering . This year we developed our net zero targets in line 
with the Science Based criteria and submitted our proposed targets  for validation . Our targets are to 
be carbon neutral for Scope 1,  2 and 3 by 2050, and shorter term to achieve a 42% absolute reduction 
in Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 (using 2021 as our base year ). We hope to have  SBTi verify our 
submission and have confirmation of our targets in due course . We will subsequently release our 
transition  plan.  
Over the year we delivered an absolute emission3 reduction of 5.5% across the business  through  the 
increased use of renewables and the sale of a carbon -intensive  asset . An additional 154 hybrid and 
electric vehicles have been added  to our fleet,  taking the total light fleet to 9.8% using renewable fuel.  
We remain committed to our targets across environment, social , and governance and you can find a 
full update on our progress in the Annual Report.
