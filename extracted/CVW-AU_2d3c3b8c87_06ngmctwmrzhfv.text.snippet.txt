Directors’ report22 ClearView Annual Report 2025Regulatory overview and changes
The financial services industry has implemented 
key regulatory reforms this year, with the Financial 
Accountability Regime applying to life insurers from 
March 2025; and APRA’s Prudential Standard CPS 230 
‘Operational Risk Management’ (CPS 230) applying 
from 1 July 2025. 
CPS 230 aims to ensure APRA-regulated entities can 
better manage operational risks and appropriately 
respond to and continue to operate through business 
disruptions. Preparing for CPS 230 compliance has 
required major changes to governance, compliance, 
contractual and incident response arrangements 
for all APRA-regulated entities. CPS 230 has also 
strengthened existing business continuity and scenario 
analysis requirements, which apply to non ‘significant 
financial institutions’, including ClearView, from 1 
July 2026. Until then, ClearView will continue to 
meet requirements in APRA Prudential Standard 232 
‘Business Continuity Management’. 
The first tranche of the Delivering Better Financial 
Outcomes (DBFO) draft legislation commenced from 
9 July 2024. This implemented 11 of the 22 Quality 
of Advice Review (QAR) recommendations. The new 
legislation includes new customer consent obligations 
for the receipt of life insurance commissions by 
advisers who provide personal advice. Draft legislation 
was also released for a second tranche of DBFO 
reforms on 21 March 2025, proposing reforms relevant 
to superannuation funds and replacing statements 
of advice with a more fit-for-purpose client advice 
record. The proposed reforms regarding the ‘new class 
of adviser’ or the modernised ‘best interests duty’ are 
yet to be released. 
A mandatory climate-related disclosure regime for 
Australian entities has commenced from 1 January 
2025. From 1 July 2026, ClearView is required to 
prepare an annual sustainability report that will form 
part of the annual report. The sustainability report 
will include a climate statement for the year and a 
directors’ declaration that reasonable steps were taken 
to ensure the contents of the sustainability report 
comply with the AASB’s Sustainability Standards. The 
climate statement is required to address the following:
• any material climate-related financial risks and 
opportunities ClearView faces;
• any metrics and targets related to climate, 
including metrics and targets relating to 
greenhouse gas emissions;
• any climate-related governance, strategy or risk 
management processes, controls and procedures of 
ClearView; and• ClearView’s climate resilience as assessed under 
two mandated scenarios of an increase in global 
average temperature of 1.5°C above preindustrial 
levels and an increase in global average 
temperature well exceeding 2°C above preindustrial 
levels
ClearView continues to actively monitor regulatory 
and legislative industry reforms. 
ClearView remains subject to oversight and review 
by regulators. ClearView’s principal regulators 
are APRA, ASIC and the Office of the Australian 
Information Commissioner.  Following the exit of the 
wealth management business, only a limited part of 
ClearView’s business is regulated by the Australian 
Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC). 
As an ASX-listed entity, ClearView is also subject to 
ASX oversight. Other government agencies may have 
jurisdiction to regulate ClearView depending on the 
circumstances. 
ClearView is also an active member of the Council 
of Australian Life Insurers (CALI), the industry body 
that was formed in 2022 to support the Australian 
life insurance industry and its members, through 
dedicated representation, engagement and advocacy, 
to drive positive outcomes for customers, insurers and 
their partners. 
Wealth management business (exit 
completed early March 2025)
ClearView completed the disposal of its funds 
management business, ClearView Financial 
Management Limited (CFML) in January 2024. The 
superannuation fund trustee, ClearView Life Nominees 
Pty Limited (CLN) retired as trustee of the ClearView 
Retirement Plan (CRP) in December 2023 and was 
subsequently deregistered in December 2024. 
In March 2025, the new external trustee of the CRP 
completed a successor fund transfer (SFT), resulting 
in the derecognition of the life investment contracts 
and related assets from the ClearView Group balance 
sheet. As a result, ClearView is operating a simpler, 
less complex business, focused on life insurance only.
The ClearView platform
Over the past four years, ClearView has invested 
heavily (in excess of $40 million) in developing its 
leading core insurance technology platform and is now 
in the final implementation phase, setting ClearView 
up for successful multi-channel expansion and 
accelerated growth.

Digital Experience aspirations, it aims to seek to 
find ways to reduce reliance on paper. In addition, 
Mandatory Climate Change initiatives are in progress 
aligned with related regulatory requirements.

governance standards. In accordance with the 4th 
edition ASX Corporate Governance Council’s Principles

Changes in state of affairs
During the financial year, the following changes 
became effective:

of the CRP completed a SFT, resulting in the 
derecognition of the life investment contracts and 
related assets from the ClearView Group balance

wealth management business.
• The on-market buyback program was announced 
on 10 March 2025, with $5.4 million worth of shares 
(11.4 million shares) being purchased over the 
period to 30 June 2025. The Board determined 
to pause the on-market share buy-back program 
pending the release of the FY25 financial results.

million of subordinated debt.
