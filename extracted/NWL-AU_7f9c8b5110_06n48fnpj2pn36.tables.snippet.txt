Introduction,
"Kate Temby, Independent Director, Chair of the People & Corporate Sustainability Committee",
"I am pleased to present Netwealth's FY25 Corporate Sustainability Report, which demonstrates our",
"continued commitment to our four sustainability pillars: enhance our core business, be genuine and",
"transparent, foster diversity, talent and wellbeing, and create a positive social and environmental",
,Kate Temby
"impact. We are dedicated to fulfilling the sustainability expectations of our stakeholders, including",
,Independent
"shareholders, clients, employees, suppliers, and regulators and creating long-term value through",
,Director
"responsible business practices, empowering people, and genuine community engagement.",
Our core strategy is to drive change that matters by delivering innovative products and services that,
"leverage data, technology and connectivity. During the year we expanded our range of investment",
"products, options and solutions to cater to the diverse and evolving needs of our clients and advisers",
and we continue to explore new markets and client segments that align with our platform's value,
proposition and competitive advantages.,
Transparency and governance remained central to our operations throughout FY25. We successfully,
integrated the Financial Accountability Regime (FAR) into our existing governance and accountability,
"frameworks, further strengthening our commitment to ethical conduct and long-term value creation.",
We launched a refreshed Code of Conduct to guide our employees on ethical behaviour and decision-,
"making, and published our ""Security at Netwealth"" webpage to reinforce our commitment to data",
protection and cybersecurity excellence.,
"Our people continue to be the foundation to our success, and we are pleased to report our employee",
"engagement score increased to 8.1, a 0.2 improvement from the previous year which places us in the",
top half of our industry peers.,
"In FY25, we achieved a significant milestone and met our gender diversity targets for both the Board",
"and Executive team, ahead of our FY26 target. This demonstrates our strong commitment to fostering",
diversity and flows from our three-year Inclusion and Diversity Strategy Roadmap we launched in,
2024. Our efforts to promote inclusive leadership and embed diversity across all levels of the,
"organisation have been supported by a range of initiatives, contributing to an increase in our",
employee score for inclusion and diversity to 8.5.,
"Through our corporate sponsorships and the Netwealth Impact Fund, we continue to deepen our",
community engagement. Our long-standing sponsorship with Banqer Primary has now helped over,
"150,000 Australian primary school students build financial literacy. Netwealth is also a sponsor for the",
"Centre for Women’s Economic Safety who host free, confidential Money Clinics for women",
"experiencing domestic and family violence. Through the Impact fund we raised $122,000 during FY25",
to grant to our charity partners Bridge It and All Things Equal.,
We have made progress towards our climate targets. This year we achieved carbon neutrality for our,
Scope 2 emissions through 100% GreenPower renewable energy procurement across facilities where,
"we have operational control. Our Scope 1 emissions totalled 11.12 tCO2e, and we continue working",
"toward our medium-term target of achieving carbon neutrality for operational scope 1, 2, and 3",
"emissions by 2030, and net zero by 2050.",
We are proactively preparing for the implementation of our climate-related financial disclosures in line,
"with the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) S2. Our approach includes Governance, Risk",

etwealth’s scope 1 and scope 2 emissions"
Netwealth is committed to understanding and reporting its carbon emissions. It has elected to apply the
operational control approach to determining the organisational boundary for its carbon footprint and its
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have been calculated by independent consultants.
