ENVIRONMENT
With mines and projects across multiple states in Australia, we operate in several unique environments  
home to diverse ecosystems. 
Our mining operations impact these 
environments, so we have designed 
processes and procedures to monitor 
and manage our environmental 
impacts. We embed these processes 
throughout our operations and 
promote awareness among our 
employees to ensure that we 
maintain our social license to operate 
and act responsibility in delivering our 
products. 
ENERGY & GREENHOUSE  
GAS EMISSIONS 
With the pressing challenges of 
climate change and the global call 
for sustainable solutions, the issues of 
energy, carbon emissions and climate 
change remain a central focus to 
our operations and our stakeholders. 
Sustainability is becoming a key 
concern for consumers and with 
growing regulatory, societal and 
investor demands, there has been 
an increase on the emphasis of Aeris 
Resources’ operational emissions and 
energy efficiency.
We are conscious of the need to 
manage our operational emissions 
and the demand for producing 
minerals with limited environmental 
impact. Simultaneously, the mass 
scale energy transition to a lower 
carbon economy presents a rising 
demand for the base and precious 
metal we produce. Copper, in 
particular, is essential for the 
renewable energy infrastructure that 
underpins the shift to sustainable 
energy systems.Aeris Resources reports Scope 1 and 
2 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions 
to the Clean Energy Regulator 
(CER) annually, in accordance with 
Australia’s National Greenhouse 
and Energy Reporting (NGER) 
Scheme. As a result, data on energy 
consumption and greenhouse gas 
emissions from fossil fuel combustion 
and electricity usage at each facility 
has been prepared and calculated 
following the NGER methodology and 
adhering to the guidelines set forth by 
the Department of Climate Change, 
Energy, the Environment and Water’s 
National Greenhouse Accounts 
(NGA) Factors (August, 2023).
Mining operations are energy-
intensive and contribute to  
Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, 
primarily from the use of fossil 
fuel-powered machinery and the 
consumption of both self-generated 
and purchased electricity. Our operations heavily rely on 
liquid fuels, primarily diesel, for 
our machinery and vehicles. This 
comprises 48% of our total energy 
profile, while liquefied petroleum 
gas (LPG) only used at our Cracow 
site makes up almost 1%. Electricity 
purchased from the grid powers our 
offices, mining infrastructure, and 
processing activities, and comprises 
37% of our total energy profile. In 
FY24, our total energy consumption 
amounted to 1,332,575 GJ. The 
energy mix across our sites varies 
based on their location, operation 
and infrastructure, with key forms of 
energy being electricity (network grid 
and natural gas generation supply) 
and diesel.

At our Tritton and Cracow operations, 
diesel is primarily used for mining 
machinery, heavy transport, and 
light vehicles. A diesel power plant 
is also required at Tritton, while 
Cracow uses LPG for boilers, furnaces, 
and production activities. At both 
sites, we use grid electricity to 
power processing activities and site 
infrastructure. 
Jaguar and North Queensland 
Operations are not connected 
to the electricity grid and rely on 
hydrocarbon-based fuels and  
natural gas, as a result of their  
remote locations.
North Queensland Operations  
use diesel as the fuel for electricity 
generation and for mining 
machinery.
At Jaguar Operations, we supply 
the natural gas used by the on-
site power station, which is owned 
and operated by Pacific Energy, 
a third-party contractor. All of the 
electricity generated from this power 
station is used exclusively by Aeris 
Resources, with none being fed back 
into the grid. As such, natural gas 
consumption for power generation 
is classified as a Scope 1 emission 
source.  Natural gas generated 
electricity is also supplemented by 
diesel-powered generators. The electricity consumption and, 
hence, natural gas consumption 
at Jaguar Operations has reduced 
significantly during the year as a 
result of the operation transitioning  
to care and maintenance.
Energy Consumption  
& Intensity 
The energy intensity of our operations 
will change from year to year 
depending on the changing 
character of the operation. Important 
characteristics that drive energy use 
are the volume of development and 
stoping activity, the depth of mining, 
capital development of new mining 
projects, grade and hardness of the 
ore, and how electrical power is 
sourced for remote operations. The 
complex interaction of these drivers 
does not allow for simple conclusions 
to be made based on year-to-year 
comparisons of energy intensity 
statistics. Our sustainability objective 
is to reduce energy consumption 
to as low as reasonably practical 
within the technical and economic 
constraints for each operation.
In FY24, Tritton experienced a 
decrease in both diesel and 
electricity consumed, amounting  
to a 22% decrease in total energy  
use as compared to FY23. The inverse trend was observed at our 
Cracow Operations where an overall 
16% increase in energy use occurred 
as compared to FY23. A significant 
contribution to this increase in energy 
intensity is associated with the diesel 
usage involved in the construction 
activities for the Tailings Storage 
Facility 2 (TSF2) capacity increase, 
which occurred during the reporting 
period.
The following table provides detailed 
information on our organisation’s 
total fuel consumption from non-
renewable sources. The data is 
presented in gigajoules and includes 
a breakdown by specific fuel types 
used during the FY24 reporting 
period.
Where no unit of primary production 
is available, as is the case for our 
Corporate Head Office, we have 
instead calculated energy and 
emissions intensity using number  
of full time employees (FTE) as at  
30 June 2024.
Due to entering care and 
maintenance during the reporting 
period, Jaguar’s energy intensity 
figure has been calculated using 
the copper and zinc production 
figures from the first quarter while the 
mine was still in production. This has 
resulted in a higher energy intensity as 
compared to FY2023.

Scope 2 (tCO2-e)
GHG Emissions
In FY24, our total Scope 1 and Scope 
2 GHG emissions across all operations 
amounted to 150,816 tCO2, 
representing a 23% decrease from 
the FY2023 figure of 196,396 tCO2. 
Scope 1 emissions, mainly from diesel 
consumption, accounted for 37% of 
our overall emissions profile, while 
Scope 2 emissions from purchased 
electricity comprised 63%. 
At Tritton and Cracow, the largest 
emissions source is electricity 
purchased from the grid, primarily 
used for processing activities. At 
Jaguar and North Queensland 
Operations, which are not connected 
to the national electricity grid, only Scope 1 emissions are present due 
to the diesel and natural gas usage 
required for powering machinery and 
on-site electricity generation. Jaguar 
experienced a 69% drop in Scope 1 
GHG emissions from FY2023, which is 
consistent with expectations with this 
site entering care and maintenance 
during the reporting period. 
In line with Australia’s NGER scheme, 
we do not currently estimate Scope 
3 emissions, which covers activities 
beyond our direct operational control 
throughout our value chain, however 
we are tracking what is occurring 
across the mining sector in relation to 
this matter.On a site-by-site basis, we have 
analysed the emissions intensity of our 
operations. In doing so, we have used 
the metric of ‘per tonne of primary 
production variable mined’. 
Jaguar’s emissions intensity figure has 
been calculated using the copper 
and zinc production figures from 
the first quarter while the mine was 
still in production. This has resulted 
in a higher emissions intensity of 3.1 
in FY24, as compared to 1.47 in FY23 
when taking into consideration the 
emissions for the whole reporting 
period. That is, including emissions 
during care and maintenance when 
no production was occurring.

Reducing Our GHG Emissions and 
Energy Consumption
Due to the high energy demands of 
mineral exploration, extraction, and 
processing, we are committed to 
finding ways to minimise our energy 
consumption and emissions. As such, 
Aeris Resources continues to look 
for Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 
reduction opportunities that are a 
fit with its ongoing efforts to achieve 
efficiencies in how it manages  
its operations. Changing the installed systems to 
new lower-emission technology is 
an economic challenge. Therefore, 
the focus for reducing emissions 
in operations is avoiding the 
consumption of energy where 
possible rather than a change in the 
mix of supply.
Where we have new projects being 
designed there is much greater 
opportunity to change the mix of 
energy supply to lower emission 
technologies. For example, the Constellation 
Project, which once constructed, is to 
provide ore to the Tritton processing 
plant has a commitment to supply 
30% of its power from a solar farm 
to be built at the mine site. The 
Constellation Project power solution 
of 30% from solar is our standard 
design assumption for all new mining 
projects where connection to the 
grid electricity supply is not feasible 
and where there is available cleared 
land that can be used with minimal 
biodiversity impact and cost.SCOPE 1 AND 2 EMISSIONS (tCO2-e) BY OPERATION (FY22 VS FY23 VS FY24)
