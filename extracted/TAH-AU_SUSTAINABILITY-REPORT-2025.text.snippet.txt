Task Force on Climate-
Related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD) 
We disclose climate-related 
information through the CDP and 
have adopted the voluntary TCFD 
framework in our Annual Report 
to align with global best 
practices. 
For FY25, we have expanded our 
TCFD reporting to enhance 
transparency and accountability. 
We included more detailed 
information regarding our 
scenario analysis and expanded 
the level of disclosures under the 
Risk management and Metrics 
and targets sections. 
In FY26, we will transition from 
reporting under the TCFD 
framework to reporting under  
the newly mandated ASRS,  
issued by the AASB. 
We are actively preparing for this 
transition so that our disclosures 
remain transparent, and aligned 
with evolving regulatory 
expectations.
Our detailed TCFD 
disclosures are available in 
our Annual Report 2025, 
available from the Investors 
section of our website at 
www.tabcorp.com.au/
investorsOur targets 
We’ve set medium and long  
term GHG emission reduction 
targets(i) aligned with science-
based target (SBT ) setting 
methodologies. Targets are 
considered “science-based”  
if they are in line with what the 
latest climate science says is 
necessary to meet the goals of 
the Paris Agreement – to limit 
global warming to well-below 2°C 
above pre-industrial levels and 
pursue efforts to limit global 
warming to 1.5°C. 
SBTs provide companies with  
a clearly defined pathway to 
future-proof growth by specifying 
how much and how quickly they 
need to reduce their GHG 
emissions.Our targets are:
45%
reduction in Scopes 1 and 2 
GHG emissions by 2030, 
from 2019 levels
27.5% 
reduction in Scope 3 GHG 
emissions by 2030, from 
2019 levels
NET ZERO
GHG emissions by 2050 
(Scopes 1, 2 and 3)Our Net Zero Roadmap 
and Plan 
We continue to reduce our GHG 
emissions by using less electricity 
in our properties, using energy-
efficient products and 
technologies, recycling or 
donating office equipment, 
transitioning to hybrid and low 
emission utility vehicles in our 
fleet, reducing the volume of 
paper we use, and encouraging 
team members to minimise their 
impacts on the environment.
Our Net Zero Plan outlines  
our key priorities and biggest 
opportunities to accelerate 
decarbonisation and achieve our 
Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions 
reduction targets. These 
opportunities include:
Installing solar and 
battery storages at 
our largest facilities 
and other locations. 
 Improving energy 
efficiency from 
lighting through LED 
upgrades and/or 
automated sensors. 
 Increasing the uptake 
of hybrid, low 
emissions utility 
vehicles and electric 
vehicles within our 
fleet.
Better managing our 
supply chain 
emissions by 
adopting a Supplier 
Carbon Framework. Opportunities identified during 
the development of our Net Zero 
Plan will help further reduce 
emissions and limit the risk that 
decarbonisation of the electricity 
grid does not materialise as 
expected. They will also help us 
reduce our operational costs.
As our largest sources of Scope 3 
emissions are related to 
purchased goods and services 
(61% in FY25), we have developed 
a Supplier Carbon Framework to 
help us manage and mitigate the 
carbon emission risk of our 
suppliers.
Achieving our Scope 3 targets will 
only be possible if our suppliers 
set their own science-based 
targets. While this is not a small 
task, we believe we’ll be building 
higher-quality relationships with 
our suppliers, which will enhance 
efficiency, transparency, and 
resiliency across our value chain.
Our Climate Change Steering 
Committee oversees the 
implementation of our Supplier 
Carbon Framework and progress 
against our Net Zero Plan. 
(i) These are net targets and relate to carbon dioxide (CO2). Our level of ambition for Scopes 1 and 2 is 1.5°C and for Scope 3 is well 
below 2°C (WB2D).

Looking ahead, we’ll continue  
to implement initiatives that 
deliver the most value to our 
business, and access additional 
opportunities to accelerate the 
decarbonisation of our business 
and value chain.
Greenhouse gas 
emissions 
Following the Demerger of our 
former Lotteries and Keno 
business in June 2022, we 
re-established our 2019 GHG 
emissions baseline to remove 
those emissions related to our 
discontinued businesses. 
While undertaking this process, 
we have improved our data 
gathering processes, expanded 
our data coverage, adapted our 
operational control methodology, 
and enhanced our disclosures. This year, we have also included 
Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions 
data from our international 
operations.
Our combined Scope 1 and Scope 
2 GHG emissions for FY25 were 
14,602 tonnes CO 2e, a decrease  
of 43% from our 2019 baseline. 
We believe we’re on track to 
achieving our Scopes 1 and 2 
medium term GHG emissions 
target of 45% reduction by 2030. 
Our Scope 3 emissions for FY25 
were 57,223 tonnes CO 2e, a 
decrease of 46% from our 2019 
baseline. This is a significant 
achievement, surpassing our 
medium term GHG emissions 
target of 27.5% reduction in 
Scope 3 emissions by 2030.BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE CONTINUED

Scope 3 emissions
Adoption of Supplier Carbon Framework Fuel used in our vehicle fleet and 
diesel generators at some offices 
and media transmitter sites, and 
gases released from refrigerants 
in air conditioning units (Scope 1) 
contributed 4.3% of total FY25 
emissions (FY24: 2.9%). 
Emissions from the consumption 
of electricity at our properties 
(Scope 2) contributed 16.0% of 
total FY25 emissions (FY24: 10.5%). 
Scope 3 emissions contributed 
79.7% of our total FY25 emissions 
(FY24: 86.6%), mostly from the 
procurement of goods and 
services.
FY25 GHG emissions by Scope 
Scope 1 – 4.3%
Scope 2 – 16.0%
Scope 3 – 79.7%Scope 1 emissions 
Our sources of Scope 1 (direct) 
emissions are from fuels used in 
fleet vehicles and on-site 
generators, natural gas, and gases 
released from refrigerants in air 
conditioning units. 
In FY25, our Scope 1 emissions 
accounted for 21.3% of our 
combined Scope 1 and 2 
emissions. 
We operate a fleet of vehicles 
used by our venue support and 
field services teams when visiting 
sites across Australia, including 
those located in regional areas. 
Fuel is also used in some of our 
offices and media transmitter 
sites to power diesel generators. 
Total vehicle fuel consumption 
was 1.13m litres in FY25, a 
decrease of 5.6% from the 
previous year. This was largely 
due to a reduction in our fleet, 
resulting in less travel, and an 
increase of hybrid and low 
emission utility vehicles, which 
are more fuel efficient.
We purchased 13 hybrid and  
57 low emission utility vehicles, 
comprising 79% of all vehicle 
purchases in FY25. These vehicles 
currently account for 55% of  
our total fleet.Composition of ﬂeet
Hybrid vehicles – 8%
Low emission utilities – 47%
Other – 45%
Our plan is to progressively 
transition to hybrid, low emission, 
electric or hydrogen powered 
vehicles in the coming years, 
provided that projected 
improvements in technology and 
supporting infrastructure 
materialises. 
Total FY25 Scope 1 emissions 
were down 11.4% from FY24, 
mainly due to a reduction in 
vehicle fuel consumption and 
transition of our forklifts from 
LPG to electric.

Scope 2 emissions 
Scope 2 (indirect) emissions are 
those associated with our 
electricity use and in FY25 
comprised 78.7% of our 
combined Scope 1 and 2 
emissions.
We use electricity sourced from 
the grid to power our corporate 
offices, warehouses, and the 
majority of other premises across 
Australia, such as TAB agencies, 
broadcasting and transmission 
infrastructure. 
Electricity use in FY25 was  
17,412 MWh, which was 8.0% below 
the prior year, predominantly due 
to site closures, relocation of our 
Sydney corporate office to a more 
energy efficient building, energy 
efficiency upgrades, solar 
installation at our Frenchs Forest 
facility in NSW, and technology 
upgrades in selected sites. 
Weather conditions also slightly 
contributed to reduced electricity 
consumption. This contributed to 
the total FY25 Scope 2 emissions 
being down 10.6% from FY24. 
We continue to increase our 
resource efficiency and reduce 
GHG emissions in areas over 
which we have control and 
influence. During FY25, we 
completed LED lighting upgrades 
and installed a 257.5 kW solar 
system in our Frenchs Forest 
broadcast and media facility  
in NSW (pictured opposite). This solar system generated  
174.5 MWh of electricity between 
November 2024 and June 2025, 
resulting in savings of 
approximately $26,170 during  
that period. 
In January 2025, we relocated  
our Sydney corporate office to  
a building with a 6-star NABERS 
Energy rating, carbon neutral 
certification, and common areas 
powered entirely by renewable 
energy. This move is expected  
to significantly reduce both 
electricity consumption and 
operating costs compared  
to our previous premise.
We’re also working through  
a program of continual 
improvement implementing  
and adopting more energy-
efficient technologies at  
selected sites across Australia. 
Some examples include:
•  Upgrading to modern inverter 
split system air conditioners 
(A/Cs), which offer significantly 
improved energy efficiency. 
These A/Cs reduce electricity 
consumption and lower 
operating costs, particularly 
during periods of peak demand.•  Upgrading the logic and 
controls for heating, ventilation 
and air conditioning (HVAC)/ 
building management systems 
(BMS), equipment, and plant 
operations. These upgrades 
leverage advanced algorithms, 
sensors, and real-time data to 
optimise performance, reduce 
waste, and dynamically adapt 
to changing conditions. The 
result is reduced power 
consumption, extended equipment lifespan, and lower 
maintenance requirements—
delivering both immediate and 
long-term operational savings.
•  Upgrading an uninterruptible 
power supply (UPS) at our 
Granville facility in NSW with a 
modern, high efficiency system. 
This newer system offers 
improved energy performance, 
reduced cooling needs, and 
enhanced battery reliability.  
 This upgrade will contribute  
to measurable reductions in 
energy use and electricity 
costs, while also improving 
system resilience.
A dedicated budget has been 
assigned to progress this work  
in FY26.BUILDING A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE CONTINUED
