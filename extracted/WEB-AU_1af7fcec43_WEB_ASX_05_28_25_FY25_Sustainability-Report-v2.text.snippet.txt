• In September 2024, Webjet Limited underwent a demerger, resulting 
in the formation of Webjet Group Limited to manage its former B2C 
businesses, leaving Webjet Limited operating the WebBeds B2B 
business only. As a result a new emissions baseline for Webjet Limited 
(now Web Travel Group) has been established in FY25.
• Reporting year is 1st Apr 2024- 31st Mar 2025. Actual data was 
provided for half year (1st Apr 2024-30th Sep 2024) and then an uplift 
factor applied to project the full year emissions.
• Emissions calculated in this report have been assessed in line with 
the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Standard and Greenhouse Gas Scope 
3 Standard methodology and prepared in line with the operational 
control consolidation approach. 
• Emission sources from all properties owned and leased by 
Web Travel Group have been included in the footprint’s boundary which 
includes all 25 facilities leased globally.
• Both Location-based and Market-based emissions were calculated for 
Scope 2 and Scope 3 Category 3 emissions for completeness.
• Category 11: Use of Sold Products contributed 94% of emissions, 
followed by Category 1: Purchased Goods and Services and Category 
2: Capital Goods, contributing 2.5% and 2.1%, respectively. These 
figures have used the Market-based approach.
• Activity or spend data was used for the footprint calculation, where a 
data gap existed, an estimation was made to fill the gap.
• Scope 1 & 2 for fuel and electricity were calculated based on the actual 
consumption and Scope 1 refrigerants emissions were estimated 
based on the m2 area of sites.
• Scope 3 Categories 1, 2, 4, & 6 emissions were calculated based on 
the spend.
• Scope 3 Category 3 emissions were calculated based on the actual fuel 
and electricity consumption.
• Scope 3 Category 7 emissions were calculated based on the number 
of full-time equivalent (FTE) employees, the expected proportion of 
employees working from home, and the number of days per week 
working from office. The average distance for commute and modes of 
transport were sourced from standard industry information.
• Scope 3 Category 11 emissions were calculated per night stays in different 
star rated sold accommodation and per spend for sold land transport.
Data preparation was externally supported, and the Company 
will commence external assurance next year in line with 
ASRS requirements.Location and market-based definitions 
Location-based emissions use average emission 
factors for the geographic location where energy is 
consumed, while market-based emissions reflect a 
company’s specific energy choices and contracts, 
including renewable energy purchases. Both are 
included for completeness in Web Travel Group’s 
reporting, and to reflect the Company’s purchase of 
renewable energy in Malaysia.
