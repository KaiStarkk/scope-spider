non-Google revenue for H2 up 36.1% compared to H2 2023.

6Significant progress to reset Appen
Throughout 2024, Appen was highly focused on resetting 
the business to achieve profitability.
In response to Google's decision to terminate its global 
services contract by 19 March 2024, Appen reduced the cost 
base by $13.5 million. 
At the beginning of 2023, we began a transformation 
process  to reset Appen to better capture the growth 
in generative Al and improve performance of our core 
business. This  included a new strategy to deliver long term 
growth and revenue diversification along with a $60 million 
cost reduction  program.
Some of the key areas identified for improvement included 
a leadership and strategy refresh, operational improvements 
to project delivery and crowd management and strengthening 
of Appen's sales and marketing functions.
We remain committed to sizing our cost base in line with 
our revenue opportunity.
Change in leadership
On 5 February 2024, we appointed Ryan KolIn as our new 
CEO  and Managing Director. In his first year as CEO, Ryan 
has led Appen to capitalise on the generative AI market 
opportunity while delivering improved financial results. 
His focus on operational excellence and cost controls have 
been instrumental to the performance of the business.
Board governance
There have been no changes to the Board in 2024. 
Vanessa  Liu and Robin Low were re-elected to the Appen 
Board by  shareholders at our AGM held in May 2024.
Executive remuneration
Appen's short-term incentive (STI) scorecard for key 
management personnel represents a combination of financial 
and non-financial metrics.
Appen will always regard its financial performance 
as paramount. Given the 2024 focus on resetting the business 
to achieve profitability, the STI weighting for the financial 
performance metrics increased to 80% from 70%. 
Non -financial metrics reflect Appen's focus on its customers, 
crowd  and people and are assigned an STI weighting of 20%.
The 2024 STI equates to 85.9% of the maximum payable, 
with  all measures above the minimum payout threshold.
I would encourage shareholders to read the remuneration 
report, commencing on page 55 .Sustainable operations
Our commitment to our stakeholders including our crowd, 
our customers and people remain as strong as ever.
We recognise the value of crowd and the benefit it provides 
to our customers. This year we undertook a significant 
digital  transformation to improve our underlying crowd 
management platform. Crowd NPS improved due to the 
platform and increasing earning opportunities as our 
business  grew throughout the year.
The high ethical treatment of our crowd remains a key priority. 
We stand by our commitment to the crowd as defined in our 
Crowd Code of Conduct, and our Global Ethical Sourcing 
and Modern Slavery Policy.
Promoting a diverse and inclusive culture across all aspects 
of Appen's business has been a long-held priority. In 2024 
Appen achieved 57% female representation among its 
employees. We maintained female representation of 50% 
among directors, and female representation among the senior 
leadership team increased to 23% from 22%.
Appen remains committed to supporting international 
initiatives to transition to net zero emissions. We have 
completed our initial Net Zero Roadmap and have committed 
to net zero by 2030. We continue to work towards assurance 
for our emissions data and remain committed to the Science 
Based Target initiative.
Closing
We are pleased with the progress made throughout 2024 
to reset the business and return to profitable growth. 
There is significant opportunity for Appen, largely driven 
by the potential of generative AI opportunities. 
Our constant focus remains on improving the company's 
performance and delivering better returns for shareholders. 
We thank shareholders for their ongoing support.
