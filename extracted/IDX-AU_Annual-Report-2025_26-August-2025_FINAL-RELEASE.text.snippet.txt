Integral Diagnostics Limited (ASX: IDX) is an Australian and New Zealand healthcare services 
company whose main activity is providing diagnostic imaging services to referrers (general 
practitioners, medical specialists, and allied health professionals), and their patients.
Diagnostic imaging is the branch of medicine that uses a range of non-invasive imaging technology to create images of bones, tissues 
and organs within the human body in order to diagnose and treat illness and injury.
Images can be produced using a variety of modalities including:
•Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI);•Nuclear medicine, including Positron Emission Tomography (PET);•Computed Tomography (CT);•Mammography;•Interventional Radiology (IR);•Ultrasound (US); and•Radiography (x-ray & EOS)
The images produced by diagnostic imaging are a critical tool for referrers in reaching a diagnosis and deciding on the most effective 
and efficient  form of treatment for patients. In this way, appropriate use of diagnostic imaging can significantly  enhance medical 
outcomes for patients while at the same time reducing the overall cost of healthcare.
