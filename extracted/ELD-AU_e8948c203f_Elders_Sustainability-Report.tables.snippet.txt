Reducing Cattle Emissions
Optimising production efficiency is a practical and commercial approach to reducing emissions intensity of our feedlot cattle. Feeding practices
"at Killara Feedlot are focused on maximising productivity without compromising nutrition and animal welfare, with the feedlot continuing to"
"explore production gain opportunities, including in the areas of genomics to access livestock with superior genetic capabilities. However,"
achievement of our 2030 target is dependent on the development and commercialisation of technology that reduces emissions produced by our
"feedlot cattle. We are actively exploring opportunities with industry, research and commercial partners to trial developments and identify best"
practices that will drive our emissions reduction ambition.
"In recent years, there have been promising developments in new feed additives to reduce enteric emissions and Elders has continued to work"
"towards practical commercial-scale solutions. Killara is closely monitoring these developments, particularly in the context of natural additives,"
and is engaging in discussions with relevant suppliers and other stakeholders. Killara will continue to investigate the use of these additives
throughout FY25.
"Exploration of approaches to evaluate the entire carbon footprint of Killara Feedlot, whilst accounting for the practices implemented is an"
"ongoing priority at Elders. The methodology we have used to date relies on desktop model evaluations and, through application of emerging"
"emissions reporting tools along with the partnership with SmartSat CRC,12 Elders is looking to take an innovative approach to emissions"
measurement going forward.
"We aim to improve our measurement of emissions by actively exploring alternate, innovative and more accurate ways of measurement and"
closely monitoring the development of knowledge and understanding in the field of livestock and entire farm business emissions calculations.
"Killara engages with the broader industry to explore new approaches, and in FY24 this has included exploring the measurement of the"
"emissions from livestock throughout the feedlot's value chain, namely, prior to the livestock's arrival on the feedlot and following its departure"
from the feedlot.
Future Developments
"Building on the actions required to achieve our interim targets, by 2050, we aim to achieve net zero Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions"
"from our operations. A variety of factors will impact the likelihood of Elders achieving this target, namely: the emergence of supportive"
"technology, particularly to address greenhouse gas emissions produced by enteric fermentation and Elders' strategy and position on the"
credible and authentic use of carbon offsets (if all other solutions are exhausted). We are committed to progressing our efforts to reduce and
eliminate emissions where commercially viable in the first instance.

precision of different measurement techniques may also vary. The absence of a significant body of
established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial information allows for
"different, but acceptable, evaluation and measurement techniques that can affect comparability"
"between entities and over time. In addition, GHG quantification is subject to inherent uncertainty"
because of evolving knowledge and information to determine emissions factors and the values needed
to combine emissions of different gases.
Emissions from Killara feedlot cattle (which contribute to Total Scope 1 emissions) are calculated
using the University of Melbourne’s Feedlot GHG Accounting Framework (F-GAF) V4.2 and Sheep
"and Beef Greenhouse Accounting Framework (SB-GAF) Monthly V2.4, as outlined in the Criteria. The"
models use proprietary input and output modelling methodology and these models may be subject to

68,2024 Sustainability Report
Basis of Preparation,
GHG Emissions - Scope 1,
Emissions sources and Reporting boundary,
Scope 1 emissions relate to:,
•,"Total fuel usage (diesel, unleaded petrol, liquid petroleum gas, natural gas); and"
"• Cattle production at Killara feedlot,",
under the Elders group’s operational control. This does not include Elders' franchised real estate offices and several saleyards at which Elders,
has a presence but are not under Elders groups' operational control.,
Standards and Methodologies,
Our Scope 1 emissions profile reflects our emissions between 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024 and was calculated using the,
following methodologies:,
For fuel use: the methodology used is set out in the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (Measurement) Determination 2008 (as updated,
"from time to time). Specifically, Elders utilises the NGER emissions and energy threshold calculator to calculate its emissions and energy.1 The",
majority of Elders’ fuel data is compiled based on actual fuel consumption of Elders’ fleet recorded by Elders’ third party fleet management,
"service provider, or is based on quantities invoiced by suppliers. Where this data is not available, estimates and assumptions are used to",
determine fuel type and quantity based on free text descriptions used by Elders staff purchasing fuel. The estimated fuel quantity is calculated,
"using the average fuel price, based on the actual fuel purchasing amount and the actual fuel consumption of Elders' fleet for the year to date.",
These assumptions are used for only a small portion of Elders’ fuel data (approximately 5%).,
For cattle production (grain-fed cattle): the methodology used to derive the relevant emissions is as set out in the Greenhouse Gas Accounting,
Framework for Feedlots produced by the University of Melbourne and based on the Australian National Greenhouse Gas Inventory methodology,
(as updated from time to time).2 A combination of data pertaining to Killara's stock-on-hand and cattle throughput was utilised when applying,
"this methodology. The stock-on-hand data was utilised to estimate the emissions for grain-fed cattle on the feedlot, but not sold during the",
"1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024 period. In prior years, only data pertaining to cattle throughput was utilised. Prior year's data has not been restated",
to incorporate stock-on-hand.,
For cattle production (grass-fed cattle): the methodology used to derive the relevant emissions is as set out in the Sheep and Beef GHG,
"Accounting Framework (Monthly)2, also produced by the University of Melbourne (as updated from time to time). Data pertaining to Killara's",
stock-on-hand was utilised when applying this methodology. The consumption of urea fertiliser used on the pasture is estimated based on the,
"average urea fertiliser used per hectare. This is the first year that emissions have been calculated for the feedlot's grass-fed program, as this",
program has increased in size throughout FY24.,
These methodologies are unable to account for sequestered carbon from minimum till farming practices at the feedlot or specific manure and,
fertiliser management practices used by the feedlot. The methodologies also exclude:,
•,"a small number of cattle that spent only a short period of time on the feedlot as compared to the other cattle, due to health reasons."
,Approximately 160 head of cattle fell within this category during 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024; and
•,"cattle that are part of Elders' 'custom-fed' program (approximately 1,800 head of cattle on this program were sold during 1 July 2023 to 30 June"
,"2024), as Elders does not have ownership of these cattle."
"In prior years, we have updated the emissions factors in these methodologies to align with the most recent IPCC Assessment Report. This year,",
"however, we have not updated these factors and have utilised the factors pre-existing in the methodologies, which are aligned to the Australian",
National Greenhouse Accounts Factors.,
GHG Emissions – Scope 2,
Reporting boundary,
Scope 2 emissions relate to consumption of purchased electricity at locations under the Elders Group’s operational control. This does,
not include Elders' franchised real estate offices and several saleyards at which Elders has a presence but are not under Elders Group's,

=== Table 12 (page 71) ===
Standards and Methodologies,
Our scope 2 emissions profile reflects our emissions between 1 July 2023 to 30 June 2024 and was calculated using the,
following methodologies.,
For Scope 2 emissions location based: using the methodology set out in the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (Measurement),
"Determination 2008 (as updated from time to time). Specifically, Elders' utilises the NGER emissions and energy threshold calculator to",
calculate its emissions and energy.3 The majority of Elders’ electricity data is compiled based on quantities invoiced by suppliers. Where actual,
"electricity data is not available, estimations are used based on historical performance of the site and/or average electricity prices for the",
"location. Estimates are used for only a small portion of Elders’ electricity data (approximately 5.5%). In our wool handling centre at Ravenhall,",
,"our solar system is owned by a third party. We treat the solar electricity generated by this system as grid supplied, as the Large-scale Generation"
"Certificates (LGCs) created by the system are not owned and retired by Elders at this time. To calculate the solar generation at this site, we",
"have relied on data provided by onsite monitoring hardware as well as applying estimates, having regard to weather conditions during the",
"period, where actual data was not available from the monitoring hardware. For this site, we have assumed that all solar power generated",
was consumed.,
For Scope 2 emissions market based: Elders procures and retires a number of Large-scale Generation Certificates (LGCs) against the electricity,
"used during the reporting period, excluding the number of equivalent LGCs calculated based on the renewable power percentage (RPP), on the",
basis that a component of electricity generated by our retailers is renewable. Elders has assumed that its electricity retailers are surrendering,
LGCs as required by the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 towards their RPP compliance obligations for the respective year.,
Sponsorships and Donations,
Elders reports the total dollar amount of payments (on an accruals basis) made by the Elders group to third parties that are categorised as,
"sponsorships or donations, and which are made during Elders’ financial year (1 October 2023 – 30 September 2024). A payment is categorised",
as a sponsorship or donation if it is any of the following:,
•,a donation made to a registered charity
•,"a donation made to, or sponsorship of, a group, event or organisation based in rural or regional communities"
•,"a donation made to, or sponsorship of, any organisation or cause that helps or supports the agriculture industry."
"All amounts are verified transactions, inclusive of GST where applicable, with the exception of donations and charitable gift transactions which",
"are exempt from GST. Elders reports on the total amount, and the proportion of this total categorised as charity-, community- and industry-",
