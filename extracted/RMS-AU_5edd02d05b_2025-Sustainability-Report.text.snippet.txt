Target achieved.
Target achieved.
Community 
EngagementMaintain contribution of up to $3/oz towards

(assuming a minimum of $2/oz).Target achieved.
Ethics & Human 
RightsAll employees to receive whistleblower, 
workplace behaviour and reporting training.Target achieved.
Taxes, supplier 
payments, and 
royaltiesImprove proportion of procurement spend 
within regional areas, reporting to Committee 
on a six-monthly basis.Target not met.  
With the transition of Edna May into care 
and maintenance, procurement spend 
in regional areas did not increase as a 
proportion of total spend on the prior year.
Climate Change 
and GHG EmissionsImprove definition of Scope 3 emissions. Target achieved. 
We have undertaken an extensive exercise 
to assess the materiality of each Scope 3 
category in our footprint, and we have 
developed a tool to better streamline the 
reporting of Scope 3 emissions for our most 
material value chain categories. 
We will use this to assess our Scope 3 
footprint each year and to determine 
opportunities for collaboration with our 
suppliers and customers.
Demonstrate preparedness of ASRS by 
achieving 75% compliance.Target achieved.  
We have made significant progress in  
uplifting our climate-related disclosures  
to meet the requirements of the Australian 
Sustainability Reporting Standards, with 
additional work completed outside of this 
report to ensure we meet the compliance 
requirements by 30 June 2026. Our current 
preparedness rate is 76%.
Mine Closure and 
RehabilitationAchieve progressive rehabilitation targets as 
set in FY25 Budget.Target achieved.
Closure and rehabilitation activities were 
undertaken across the Edna May, Marda* 
Tampia and Symes projects. 
1. * Note Marda assets were divested during the  
reporting period.

We are proud of our climate progress in the current 
period. Our total energy consumption for FY25 was 
1,981,308 GJ, which results in a 15% decrease in energy 
consumption from the prior year. Our total Scope 1 and 
2 emissions was 122,755tCO2-e, also representing a 17% 
decrease from last year. This was due to commencement 
of solar power generation from our new 6.7 MW solar 
farm at Mt Magnet and transitioning Edna May to care 
and maintenance.
Our FY25 emissions intensity* per ounce of gold 
produced was 0.41tCO2-e/oz. This is a reduction of 
0.09 tCO2-e/oz from last year. An in-depth breakdown 
of our annual energy consumption and GHG emissions 
can be found in our ESG Databook.

FY25 FY24 FY23A review from FY25 showed that the majority of our 
Scope 1 emissions come from diesel consumption, 
accounting for 73% of emissions. The estimated 
distribution of these emissions is 53% from stationary 
sources (machinery and equipment), 31% from 
transportation and 17% from power generation. 
Additionally, natural gas contributes 26% of Scope 1 
emissions, used solely for power generation. We are 
hopeful we can leverage the work done at the hybrid 
power project at Mt Magnet to date to continue our 
emission reduction trajectory. 
In order to prepare for AASB S2 climate-related 
financial disclosure frameworks, we have engaged 
a third-party to assess the controls and processes in 
place for recording our GHG emissions for reporting 
purposes. We are implementing recommendations 
provided in anticipation of the new regulations in the 
2026 financial year. 
Scope 3 Emissions 
Calculations
Scope 3 emissions encompass a broader range of 
greenhouse gas emissions that occur throughout the 
entire product life cycle. These are increasingly being 
used to understanding and assessing a company’s 
entire value chain emissions impact and identify areas 
of high risk, and where a company has most opportunity 
to influence and impact the emissions of its suppliers, 
customers and other value chain inputs. We engaged 
third-party consultants to provide a tool for the collection 
of Scope 3 data and calculations in FY25. This helped us 
gain insight into our carbon footprint beyond our direct 
operations (Scope 1) and indirect emissions from energy 
consumption (Scope 2) and become prepared for the 
changes to the AASB S1 and S2 standards, which require 
more rigorous and detailed climate-related disclosures.
For FY25, we calculated our Scope 3 emissions footprint 
to be 166,131 tCO2-e. The following categories were 
considered in our assessment:
 ࣈPurchased goods and services
 ࣈCapital goods
 ࣈFuel and energy related activities
 ࣈUpstream transportation and distribution 
 ࣈWaste generated in operations 
 ࣈBusiness travel
 ࣈEmployee commuting 
 ࣈDownstream transportation and distribution 
 ࣈProcessing of sold products 
The most significant contributions to our Scope 3 
emissions were from purchased goods and services, fuel 
and electricity consumption in our operations not already 
considered in our Scope 1 and 2 emissions footprint, and 
the purchase of capital goods. A detailed breakdown of 
this data can be found in our ESG Databook.
