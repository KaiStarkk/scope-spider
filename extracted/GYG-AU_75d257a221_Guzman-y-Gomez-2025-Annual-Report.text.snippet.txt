FY25 PROGRESS METRICS LOOKING FORWARD
Climate Action
•Development of emissions reduction 
framework and initiatives across the value chain. 
•Preparation for Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards mandatory disclosure requirements – climate gap analysis and emissions inventory.•Scope 1 (direct)emissions 4,651 tCO
2e.
•Scope 2 (location-based)emissions 11,697 tCO
2e.•Detailed assessment of Scope 3 indirect emissions and development of decarbonisation strategies across material emissions sources.
•Adoption of data governance framework and digital tools to support emissions monitoring and reporting. 
CLIMATE ACTION
GYG’s approach to climate action 
is grounded in understanding not only the impact of climate change on its operations but equally, the impacts of GYG on climate.
In FY25, GYG continued its climate 
action journey, aligned with current climate science and evolving regulatory standards. This work reflects both an internal ambition and public commitment to transparency through emerging sustainability disclosure frameworks. While progress is ongoing, GYG is dedicated to making a real, measurable difference – starting with the issues that matter most.
In FY25 GYG adopted a framework 
to guide the Group’s emissions reduction goals and initiatives. Scope 2 emissions are a key focus for the year ahead, particularly in relation to targeted reduction initiatives that can be activated in the restaurant environment. GYG also recognises the significant opportunity to collaborate with suppliers and prioritise Scope 3 emission sources most material to the Group’s overall footprint.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING 
STANDARDS
GYG is actively preparing for 
the introduction of mandatory climate-related financial disclosures in Australia, effective from 1 January 2025. These disclosures will follow the Australian Sustainability Reporting Standard – AASB S2 Climate-Related Disclosures , 
which closely aligns with the global IFRS S2 standard developed by the International Sustainability Standards Board (“ISSB”).
In FY25 GYG completed a gap 
assessment and developed a disclosure readiness schedule aligned with AASB S2. Based on the outcomes of the assessment, GYG is developing an implementation roadmap. This roadmap will outline key actions, timelines, and disclosure priorities necessary to support the Group’s compliance and alignment with AASB S2 over the reporting horizon.GYG is utilising a carbon accounting technology platform to support the monitoring and calculation of emissions based on purchasing activity and spend, creating efficiencies from a resourcing and data management perspective.
GHG EMISSIONS INVENTORY
As part of GYG’s commitment to transparency and accountability in environmental performance, the Company prepared a greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions inventory for FY25. 
The boundary for the inventory 
is defined in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, encompassing all direct (Scope 1) and indirect (Scope 2) emissions from corporate restaurant operations across Australia and the US. 
In FY25, the Group’s scope 1 and 2 
GHG emissions were 16,348 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, representing an increase of 13% on FY24.ENVIRONMENT
GYG CONSIDERS BOTH THE RESTAURANT ENVIRONMENT AND THE BROADER NATURAL WORLD IN SHAPING ITS 
APPROACH TO REDUCING EMISSIONS AND SUPPORTING THRIVING ECOSYSTEMS. AS A COMPANY THAT PRIDES ITSELF ON SERVING FRESH PRODUCE AND HIGH-QUALITY INGREDIENTS, PROTECTING THE HEALTH OF THE PLANET IS ESSENTIAL TO GYG’S LONG-TERM SUSTAINABILITY AND SUCCESS. GYG’S GENERATIONAL APPROACH IS CENTRAL TO THE STRATEGY AND PROGRAMS BEING ACTIVATED, TO IMPROVE ITS IMPACTS NOW AND INTO THE FUTURE.

*Scope 1 includes combustion of stationary fuel (natural gas 
and LPG) and leakage of refrigerant gases (fugitive emissions).
**Scope 2 emissions encompass emission generated to create electricity used at GYG offices and corporate restaurants.
In FY25, GYG increased its corporate restaurant count 
by 28% and corporate restaurant sales increased by 27% across Australia and the US. The number of 24/7 restaurants have also increased from 5 to 18 in Australia during FY25.While absolute reduction of Scope 1 and 2 emissions remains GYG’s long-term goal, an emissions intensity model has been considered to provide greater visibility into performance during a period of rapid expansion. This enables GYG to track efficiency gains and support decarbonisation efforts as the company scales.
