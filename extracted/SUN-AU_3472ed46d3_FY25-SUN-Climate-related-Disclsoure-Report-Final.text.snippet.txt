Board oversight
The SGL Board and the Vero Insurance New Zealand Limited Board (VINZL) each 
have their own regular schedule of meetings throughout the financial year to 
discuss matters outlined in their respective charters. They have oversight of climate-
related risks and opportunities across Australia and New Zealand respectively, and 
are accountable for the approval of climate-related targets and annual climate-
related disclosure reports. They delegate authority to their own respective Board 
Risk and Audit Committees through their charters1 for specific governance activities. 
The SGL Board Risk Committee (BRC) meets at least four times per year, and 
approves the risk appetite for climate-related risk and oversees management of 
these risks including transition and physical risks. The BRC reviews and approves 
climate scenario analysis and outcomes. 
The SGL Board Audit Committee meets at least four times per year, and 
recommends updates or changes in relation to climate-related reporting and 
other sustainability matters to the SGL Board. 
In FY25, the SGL Board and its Committees considered a wide range of key 
climate-related physical and transition risks and opportunities impacting 
reinsurance, natural hazard allowances, risk selection and pricing, climate-related 
regulatory change, and climate transition targets.
Board Skills
The board skills matrix outlines the current skills and expertise of the Board, including 
in areas relevant to the management of physical and transition risks. It covers a 
range of categories, such as strategy; major change and transformation, regulatory 
environment; risk management; customer outcomes; sustainability; and accounting 
and financial reporting. The Board skills matrix and annual self-assessment are 
designed to ensure the Board has the capability to identify, assess and monitor 
responses to existing and emerging risks and opportunities arising from environmental 
and social issues. 
Management role
Suncorp’s Executive Leadership Team (ELT) is responsible for identifying and 
managing climate-related risks and opportunities across the organisation. 
Where required, these matters may be escalated to relevant ELT management 
committees, such as the Executive Risk Committee, and, if appropriate, further 
to the Suncorp Group Limited Board or its committees. The ELT is supported in 
these responsibilities by recommendations and advice from both internal and 
external experts, as well as input from business governance committees including 
the Responsible Investment Committee and AASB S22 Steering Committee. 
These processes are underpinned by a suite of internal policies, controls, and 
procedures, developed in line with Suncorp’s broader standards, to guide the 
Group’s response to climate-related risks and opportunities.
While there are no standalone climate-related measures in Suncorp’s executive 
remuneration framework, appropriate consideration and management of climate-
related physical risks can impact executive remuneration outcomes. For example, 
indirect links to physical risk are embedded in risk management performance 
measures in the executive remuneration framework and Suncorp’s scorecard.Climate-related risks and 
opportunities that form part of our  
ELT accountabilities include:

Climate Transition Plan
Suncorp’s Climate Transition Plan focuses on our operations, investment portfolio and supply chain. The new and updated targets (refer to 
the table below) replace our previous Climate Change Action Plan, with prior commitments either achieved or revised. 
Suncorp is preparing to adhere to the mandatory climate reporting requirements outlined by the Australian Sustainability Reporting 
Standards. We note that the Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB) is determining whether Scope 3 insurance-associated emissions 
relating to the underwriting of our customers must be included. Accordingly, Suncorp will defer any decision regarding the disclosure of 
insurance-associated emissions until the AASB has issued its determination.

Scope 1 & 2 emissions
Restated Scope 1 & 2 emissions and performance
Suncorp to reduce our absolute Scope 1 & 2 emissions to net-zero by 2030 from an FY20 baseline.
Our Scope 1 & 2 net-zero 2030 target requires Suncorp to reduce absolute emissions by at least 90% with the residual emissions abated 
through high-quality nature- or technology-based carbon credits. This 2030 net-zero target applies to activities associated with Suncorp’s 
insurance operations in Australia and New Zealand.
To achieve our Scope 1 & 2 net-zero target by 2030, we intend to maintain our renewable electricity supply agreements, further enhance the 
energy efficiency of our buildings, and progressively reduce the size of our corporate fleet whilst continuing the transition to hybrid and 
electric vehicles. Our assumption is there will continue to be a competitive market for renewable electricity products, and an ongoing supply 
of hybrid and electric vehicles into Australia between now and FY30. 
In the short-term Suncorp's focus is on absolute emissions reduction however, if Suncorp decides to purchase carbon credits in the future 
to meet its net-zero goals, it expects to consider the principles aligned to the most current global best practices. We will ensure the high 
integrity of the credits purchased and disclose the relevant assessment criteria along with purchased carbon detail.
Our Scope 1 & 2 emissions performance
In FY25, we achieved: 10% year-on-year reduction in our Scope 1 & 2 market-based emissions. Contributing to a total reduction of 85%1, 4 from  
a restated FY20 baseline. 
Scope 1 & 2 net-zero performance restated

Scope 1 & 2 (market-based) % reduced from FY20 baseline 0 74% 83% 85%
Progress to date can be attributed to renewable electricity supply agreements which include the purchase of renewable energy certificates, 
selecting energy efficient buildings, installing rooftop solar in viable locations, and the transition of our corporate fleet to hybrid and  
electric vehicles.
 
The recent divestment of Suncorp Bank and Asteron Life, resulted in a change to our organisational boundary. We've recalculated 
our FY20 Scope 1 & 2 emissions baseline to exclude emissions from Suncorp Bank and Asteron Life in the FY20 baseline year and are 
restating performance towards our 2030 net-zero target.
The current year Scope 1, 2 and upstream 3 emissions and other environmental metrics such as renewable electricity data are reported 
using a 10 +2 approach. This means that FY25 metrics include 10 months of actual and estimated data up to 30 April 2025 and 2 months of 
forecast data up to 30 June. Our prior 10+2 data is restated to full 12 months data each year.
Refer to our FY25 Sustainability Data Pack - Environment section for historical performance and additional detail on Scope 1, 2 and 
upstream Scope 3 metrics, and the Climate Reporting Supplement for methodological notes and the basis upon which these metrics and 
targets are prepared.
1.  Subject to limited independent assurance by KPMG. Please refer to the assurance opinion included on the Suncorp website, https://www.suncorpgroup.com.au/corporate-
responsibility/reports.
2.  Metrics restated due to a change in organisational boundary. FY24 metrics restated from the previously disclosed 10+2 metric to reflect 12 months of data. 
3.  Slight variances may occur when comparing the total annual sum of Scope 1 & 2 market-based emissions to the individual Scope 1 and Scope 2 emission categories due to rounding.
4.  FY25 GHG metrics reported on a 10+2 basis. See the Climate Reporting Supplement for details on methodology and basis for preparation.
