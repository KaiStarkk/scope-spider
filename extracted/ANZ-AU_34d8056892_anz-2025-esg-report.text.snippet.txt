including statements regarding our 
intent, belief or current expectations 
with respect to the Group’s business 
operations, market conditions, results 
of operations and financial condition, 
sustainability objectives or targets, and 
risk management practices. Those 
matters are subject to risks and 
uncertainties that could cause the 
actual results and financial position of 
the Group to differ materially from the 
information presented herein. When 
used in the report, the words

‘anticipate’, ‘believe’, ‘expect’, ‘may’, 
‘probability’, ‘risk’, ‘will’, ‘seek’, ‘would’, 
‘could’, ‘should’ and similar 
expressions, as they relate to the 
Group and its management, are 
intended to identify forward-looking 
statements or opinions. 
Those statements are usually 
predictive in character; or may be 
affected by inaccurate assumptions 
or unknown risks and uncertainties 
or may differ materially from results 
ultimately achieved. As such, these 
statements should not be relied upon 
when making investment decisions. 
There can be no assurance that actual

Climate-related information
This report may contain climate-related 
statements, including in relation to 
climate-related risks and opportunities, 
climate-related goals and ambitions, 
emissions reduction pathways and 
climate projections. While the statements 
were prepared in good faith, climate-
related statements are subject to 
significant uncertainty, challenges and 
risks that may affect their usefulness, 
accuracy and completeness, including:
1. Availability and reliability of data  – 
emissions and climate-related data 
may be incomplete, inconsistent, 
unreliable or unavailable (including 
information from the Group’s 
customers), and it may be necessary 
to rely on assumptions, estimates or 
proxies where that is the case.
2. Uncertain methodologies and modelling  
methodologies, frameworks and 
standards used for calculations of 
climate-related metrics, modelling and 
climate data are not universally applied, 
are rapidly evolving and subject to 
change. This may impact the data 
modelling, approaches, and targets 
used in preparation of this report.
3. Complexity of calculations and 
estimates  – estimating financed or 
facilitated emissions (including 
allocating emissions to banking 
activities) and emissions reduction is 
complex and relies on assumptions 
and judgments, often made in respect 
of long periods of time.
4. Changes to climate-related governing 
frameworks  – changes to climate-
related policy, laws, regulations and 
market practices, standards and 
developments, including those resulting 
from legal proceedings and regulatory 
investigations.The information in this notice should 
be read with the qualifications, 
limitations and guidance included 
throughout this report and in:

2025 ESG Data and Frameworks Pack 
available at anz.com/esgreport5. Lack of consistency in definitions 
and climate-science terminology 
subject to changes – definitions 
and standards for climate-related 
data and assessment frameworks 
used across industries and 
jurisdictions may vary, and 
terminology and concepts relating 
to climate science and 
decarbonisation pathways may 
evolve and change over time. These 
inconsistencies and changes can 
also make comparisons between 
different organisations’ climate 
targets and achievements difficult 
or inappropriate.
6. Reliance on third parties for data or 
involvement  – the Group may need 
to rely on assistance, data or other 
information from external data and 
methodology providers or other third 
parties, which may also be subject 
to change and uncertainty. 
Additionally, action and continuing 
participation of third parties, such 
as stakeholders, may be required 
(including financial institutions and 
governmental and non-
governmental organisations).
Due to these uncertainties, challenges 
and risks, statements, assumptions, 
judgments, calculations, estimates 
or proxies made or used by the 
Group may turn out to be incorrect, 
inaccurate or incomplete. Readers 
should conduct their own independent 
analysis and not rely on the information 
for investment decision-making.Information

Targets12025 outcomes and performance 
Savings program pilots 
Pilot a savings program2 for people on lower incomes 
in Fiji and Vanuatu by end 2025, with at least 80% of 
participants having demonstrated a savings habit3 upon 
completion. (Pacific)Achieved
The savings program2 pilots were successfully completed in Fiji and 
Vanuatu. Both pilots exceeded their targets, with 85% of participants 
in Fiji and 90% of participants in Vanuatu demonstrating a savings 
habit3 upon completion. A third pilot commenced in Solomon Islands.
Large Emitters Engagement Program (LEEP)
Enhance our management of climate risks  and opportunities 
by intensifying our engagement with our largest emitting 
business customers. We will expect and encourage them to 
strengthen their low carbon transition plans , by focusing our 
engagement and raised expectations on our 100 largest 
emitting business customers with the aim that by end 2025, 
compared to their starting point more customers are assessed 
as being in a ‘mature’ phase of their low carbon transition plans.Achieved
45 customers were assessed as being in a ‘mature’ phase of their low 
carbon transition plans, up from 42 in 2024.4
Operational emissions and non-emissions
Reduce the direct impact of our business activities on the environment5 by:
Reducing combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions 
85% by 2025 and 90% by 2030 (against 2015 
baseline);6Achieved
Our combined Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions have decreased by 
96% since 2015.
Being powered by the equivalent of 100% renewable  
electricity  by 2025;7Not achieved
97% of ANZ's electricity needs were from renewable sources, just falling 
short of our target of 100%. This was principally due to the absence of 
recognised schemes or renewable electricity infrastructure in Papua 
New Guinea and Pacific countries.
Reducing water consumption8 by 40% by 2025 
(against 2017 baseline);Achieved
Our water consumption has decreased by 61% since 2017.
Reducing waste to landfill9 by 40% by 2025 
(against 2017 baseline);Achieved
Our waste to landfill has decreased by 79% since 2017.
Reducing paper consumption (both office and ANZ 
originated customer paper use) by 70% by 2025 
(against 2015 baseline).Achieved
Our paper consumption has decreased by 77% since 2015.
New Zealand retail lending
Helping New Zealand homeowners improve the 
sustainability of their homes and/or reduce their transport 
emissions through discounted lending of at least NZ$825m 
in aggregate to at least 19,700 households by end 2025. 
(New Zealand)Achieved
Since October 2020 we have supported 23,397 households into 
healthier homes and NZ$938.86 million lending through:
• Our Healthy Home Loan Package;
• Our Good Energy Home Loan Top Up;
• Interest-free Insulation Loans.10
Gender equity targets11
Maintain representation of women as Key Management 
Personnel (KMP)12 of at least 40%.Not achieved
As at 30 September 2025, women as KMP12 has decreased from four 
out of ten, to three out of nine and is now below target at 33%. When 
the recently announced permanent Executive Committee13 appointments 
of Stephen White, Pedro Rodeia, Christine Palmer and Donald Patra 
commence from October to December 2025, women as KMP will 
increase back to 40%.
Increase the representation of Women in Leadership  (WIL) 
by 1.2 percentage points (ppt) from baseline of 39.0%.14Achieved
We have exceeded our WIL target this year by 0.3 ppt to 40.5% – an 
annual increase of 1.5 ppt. 
1. Targets exclude Suncorp Bank unless otherwise stated. 2.  Saver Plus. 3.  Eight out of 10 months saving (as per Saver Plus program), measured by participant survey data. 4.  In 2024, 42 
customers were assessed as ‘Mature’. Between 2024 and 2025, four of our 100 largest emitting customers upgraded to ‘Mature’, and one customer who was assessed as ‘Mature’ in 2024 was 
removed from LEEP due to acquisition. In 2025, we expanded LEEP to additional customers subject to the Safeguard Mechanism, certain customers in our sectoral pathways and other large 
emitters. Within this expanded LEEP cohort, there are 77 customers assessed in the 'Mature' phase as at end 2025. For further detail, refer to page 12 in the 2025 Climate Report available at anz.
