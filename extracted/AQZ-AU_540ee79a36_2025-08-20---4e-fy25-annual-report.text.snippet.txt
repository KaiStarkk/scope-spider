Chairman’s 
Letter
Dear Shareholders,  
I am pleased to present my first  
report as Chairman of Alliance 
Aviation Services Limited, for  
the FY2025 financial year.
The operational, financial  
and strategic performance of  
the Group was characterised  
by resilience, reliability  
and sustainability, which  
is the theme of this year’s 
annual report.
Alliance managed considerable 
external pressures to achieve 
record flight hours for the fifth 
consecutive year and maintain 
industry leading on-time 
performance, and at the same 
time made substantial progress 
in implementing its longer-term 
strategic plans. 
The Group reported a solid 
financial performance with 
improvements in earnings  
before interest, depreciation  
and amortisation, net assets  
and operating cash flow. On this 
basis, I am pleased to advise 
that the Board of Directors have 
declared a dividend of a 3.0 cents 
per share fully franked.
Strategic sales of inventory and 
aircraft engines during the year 
will strengthen the reliability 
of our operations by improving 
access to spare parts for our E190 fleet, and have enabled  
the Group to reduce its debt  
from December 2024.
Our fleet expansion program 
neared completion with the 
acquisition of ten Embraer 
E190 aircraft settled during the 
year and the remaining ten due for 
settlement in FY2026. To support 
this expansion, the  
Group acquired additional  
hangars at Brisbane Airport and 
has expanded our workforce to 
more than 1,450 people.
The Board of Alliance Aviation 
Services has undergone significant 
renewal during the last financial 
year. David Crombie AM and Peter 
Housden retired as directors in 
October 2024. Alliance Airlines 
Co-founder and Chairman, Steve 
Padgett OAM retired from the 
Board in February 2025. These 
three non-executive directors 
served the Group since its ASX 
listing in December 2011, and have 
been instrumental in establishing 
Alliance Airlines as Australia’s 
leading air charter operator and 
setting the foundations for the 
Group’s continuing success. 
Mark Stanton and I were 
appointed to the Board in July 
2024, and Bernie Campbell 
joined in February 2025. We are 
honoured to serve the Group on 
behalf of the shareholders, and 
excited to build on the strong 
foundations created by the Board 
and management team. 
On behalf of the Board,  
I would like to thank the three 
departing directors for their 
outstanding service. 
As a Group One organisation under 
the Commonwealth Government 
Safeguard Mechanism, Alliance 
is on track to meet its climate-
related disclosure requirements 
in FY2026 as mandated by the 
Corporations Act 2001 Chapter 2M.  
“ The outlook for the 
Group in FY2026 
remains positive.”
James Jackson 
ChairmanThe Group measures and reports 
its Scope 1 and 2 emissions under 
the National Greenhouse and 
Energy Reporting Scheme, and has 
a range of initiatives underway to 
review energy use and emissions 
from our business.
The outlook for the Group in 
FY2026 remains positive with 
the first full year of wet lease 
operations for Qantas. A range 
of initiatives underway are being 
undertaken to improve utilisation 
of aircraft and operational 
resources. As the fleet expansion 
is finalised during this financial 
year, we are focused on improving 
operational reliability and cost 
management, and optimising cash 
flow to reduce debt levels. 
Further to these operational 
initiatives the board has engaged 
the services of a corporate 
adviser to undertake a strategic 
review of the group. They will be 
assisting the board to further 
develop strategy and actions 
with the objective of converting 
the significant growth and scale 
now in the business into greater 
shareholder value.
In closing, I would like to thank 
Alliance’s staff and contractors 
for their hard work and dedication 
to providing safe and reliable 
service for our clients. Thank 
you also to our shareholders 
for your continued support for 
Alliance Airlines.

The Group has also invested 
in new operating systems to 
improve operations and crew 
management, fleet growth and 
utilisation, and engineering 
productivity. 
These improvements are 
assisting in generating additional 
aircraft capacity from the 
expanded E190 fleet to satisfy 
client demand. 
We are also placing greater 
management emphasis on 
disciplined cost management 
to maximise cash flow, and give 
the Group increased flexibility 
to reduce debt and generate 
dividends for shareholders. 
SUSTAINABILITY
Alliance continues to implement 
initiatives with respect to fuel 
efficiency, flight planning and 
engine management as part of 
efforts to reduce CO2 emissions. These actions align with our 
strategic objectives to reduce 
the Group’s carbon footprint, 
enhance fuel efficiency, and 
promote the development and 
use of sustainable aviation fuels. 
Alliance Aviation Services is 
a Group 1 emitter under the 
Commonwealth Government 
Safeguard Mechanism, which 
requires the Group to meet 
mandatory AASB S2 climate-
related financial reporting 
standards from the current 
financial year. 
These initiatives will form part 
of the Group’s Climate Action 
Plan which is currently being 
prepared by the leadership team 
to provide a clear plan for our 
staff, management, Board and 
stakeholders. 
The plan will be approved by the 
Board and set out our objectives, 
actions and performance 
indicators so that we can monitor 
and report on our progress 
over time. CONCLUSION
The operational and financial 
performance of the Group during 
the FY2025 financial year has 
demonstrated the resilience 
of our business model and 
reinforced the importance of 
focusing on our core values of 
safety, on-time performance 
and financial sustainability. I 
would like to thank all of the 
Alliance staff and contractors for 
their efforts to live up to these 
values during a year which has 
presented the business with a 
range of challenges. 
Thank you also to our clients 
and suppliers for your continued 
support and trust in Alliance as a 
partner to your businesses, and 
to the Board for your confidence 
and guidance.

Directors’ Report (cont.)The remaining ten aircraft under the second tranche 
are scheduled for settlement in FY2026, consistent 
with the Group’s fleet planning and long-term 
operational commitments. One of these aircraft has 
been sold with the airframe going to Eirtrade and 
the engines to Beautech. These transactions will be 
settled in FY2026.
OUTLOOK AND DIVIDEND
OUTLOOK
The outlook for FY2026 is positive, driven by 
increased wet lease flying, and improved utilisation 
of both aircraft and crew resources.
 fContract activity is expected to continue its 
organic growth, driven by increased demand 
from existing clients and new business 
opportunities, particularly within Western 
Australia and Queensland.
 fWith Qantas exercising its final four wet lease 
options in FY2025, FY2026 will mark the first 
full year of Qantas wet lease operations. This is 
anticipated to contribute to higher revenue and 
improved crew utilisation and efficiency.
 fThe Rockhampton hangar will expand its base 
maintenance capabilities. This enhancement will 
reduce the need for ferry flights to offshore MRO 
facilities, thereby lowering the Group’s carbon 
emissions and operating costs, and improve fleet 
availability with less time spent ferrying aircraft 
internationally.
 fThe Group remains committed to pursuing 
strategic Aviation Services transactions that 
deliver enhanced profitability, generate cash 
flows and align operational capacity.
 fThe Group will continue to focus on cost 
management during the year, thus ensuring that 
profitability margins are maintained and, where 
possible, increased.
During the forecast period, Alliance will continue 
to prioritise its core business activities, focusing 
on the provision of air transport services to the 
resources sector and the supply of wet lease 
capacity to other carriers, capitalising on market 
opportunities as they arise. With the overall fleet 
expansion phase coming to an end, the Group will 
shift its strategic emphasis toward disciplined 
financial management, with a particular focus on 
optimising cash flow and reducing debt levels.DIVIDEND
The Directors have resolved to declare a full 
franked dividend of 3.0 cents per ordinary share for 
the year ended 30 June 2025. The record date is 
3 September 2025.
OTHER RELEVANT FACTS
RISKS
The key risks faced by the Group that have the 
potential to affect the financial prospects of the 
Group, as disclosed above, and how the Group 
manages these risks, include:
 fAbility to meet client demand — The Group 
recognises the risk that pilot recruitment and 
training challenges could impact its ability 
to meet growing client capacity demands. 
To mitigate this risk, the Group proactively 
recruits pilots well in advance of operational 
requirements, and leverages a network of flight 
simulators across Australia and internationally to 
ensure timely and effective training delivery.
 fInternational supply chain — The Group 
faces potential risks associated with the 
timely and efficient sourcing of aircraft parts, 
and the availability of third-party repair and 
overhaul services. To mitigate these risks, 
the Group employs long-term forecasting of 
parts and maintenance requirements, pursues 
opportunistic acquisitions of parts packages, 
and actively seeks to engage local or domestic 
suppliers where feasible. In addition, the Group 
has entered into a strategic arrangement with 
AVIAN Inventory Management LLC, the world’s 
largest holder of Embraer inventory. This 
partnership enhances supply chain resilience 
by providing greater certainty and reliability in 
the availability of critical components for the 
Embraer fleet.
