Dear Shareholder,
On behalf of the Board, we are pleased to present Yancoal’s 2024  Remuneration Report.
2024  REFLECTIONS AND PERFORMANCE
The year 2024 marked a continued period of strategic focus and operational excellence for Yancoal. Building on the recovery efforts 
initiated in 2023, our mines maintained their emphasis on pre-strip and overburden removal to sustain optimal mine profiles and ensure 
long-term productivity. These efforts contributed to improved operational efficiency and enhanced saleable coal volumes across the 
year.
Yancoal remains dedicated to enhancing long-term shareholder value by driving profitability while mitigating financial, operational, 
environmental, and social risks. Our commitment to safety and transparency supports our goal of zero harm across all operations. The 
Board, alongside the Health, Safety, Environment and Community Committee, continues to prioritise reducing our Total Recordable Injury 
Frequency Rate (TRIFR). As of 31 December 2024, our 12-month rolling TRIFR stood at 6.7 (5.1 in 2023). While our safety performance 
showed improvement late in the year, it remains below the level we strive for. Safe mines are productive mines, and we remain committed 
to improving this trend through targeted safety intervention activities. Keeping our workforce safe is always our first consideration. 
Although our TRIFR remains below the industry average, we recognise there is still work to be done. 
We also deeply regret the tragic passing of Craig Hugo, a contractor at our Austar site, following an incident during a care and 
maintenance operation in September. We extend our heartfelt condolences to Craig's family, friends, and colleagues, and remain 
committed to providing them with full support as they navigate this difficult time.
In line with Yancoal’s commitment to operational resilience and su stainable growth, the Group delivered on its production targets for 
2024, producing 36.9  million  tonnes of saleable coal at a cash operating cost of $93 per tonne. These results underscore the dedication 
and capability of our workforce, as well as the effectiveness of our strategic priorities.
Yancoal’s financial performance in 2024 has been exceptional, further strengthening its financial position with a cash balance of $2.46 
billion. This positions the Group with the financial capacity to pursue corporate initiatives.
As Yancoal entered the S&P/ASX 300 Index in 2024, we now have an opportunity to enhance our corporate governance practices further. 
In 2025, we will develop a plan aimed at achieving a gender-balanced board within a specified timeframe, reflecting our commitment to 
diversity and strong governance principles.
We also progressed work on the potential renewable energy hub at Stratford. This concept provides an excellent opportunity for the 
beneficial re-use of land post-mining and could provide economic and social benefits to the Gloucester region, subject to both internal 
and external approval processes. The Company intends to develop a decarbonisation plan that incorporates abatement activities and 
includes the purchase of credits to meet our emission requirements.
The dedication and resilience of our employees have been central to Yancoal’s success in 2024. Their c ontributions have  enabled us to 
navigate the challenges of the year and achieve outstanding outcomes for all stakeholders.
Key operational highlights include:
  
Strong Safety Culture:  12-month 
rolling TRIFR of 6.7, below the 
comparable industry average of 9.0.
   
Saleable Production:  Achieved 
attributable saleable coal production 
of 36.9Mt  after addressing the 
operational challenges
  
Realised Coal Price:  Average 
realised coal price of A$176/t
2024  EXECUTIVE REMUNERATION OUTCOMES
The 2024 performance has resulted in Executive Short-Term Incentive Plan (“STIP”) awarded at 126.3% of target. In assessing executive 
performance, we utilise our balanced scorecard approach which reinforces the need for our Executive team to deliver both financial and 
non-financial priorities where performance is measured against production and cash costs. The Executive STIP Outcomes section of this 
report provides more detail on this year’s scorecard performance.
The LTIP offered in May 2021 has vested at 87.33% of the total grant. Earnings per share (“EPS”) since 1 January 2021 has increased by 
130% placing Yancoal between the 50th and the 75th percentile of our comparators. The Cost Target component beat the top 20th 
percentile of our comparators. The LTIP vesting reflects the efforts of the executive team in driving value for shareholders.
This report sets out remuneration information for the Group’s Key Management Personnel (“KMP”) for the 12 months ended 31 December 
2024 .
Yours sincerely,
Debra Bakker
Chair of the Nomination and Remuneration CommitteeREMUNERATION REPORT - AUDITED

SUSTAINABILITY 
Under the Board’s direction, Yancoal’s HSEC Committee has 
oversight of Yancoal’s Sustainability Strategy. The Sustainability 
Strategy takes a holistic approach to the consideration of 
decarbonisation opportunities, renewable energy projects and 
the pursuit of diversification into minerals and commodities 
beyond coal as potential elements which could underpin the 
ongoing sustainability of Yancoal’s business into the future.  
In April 2024, the Group published its first Sustainability Report, 
for the 2023 calendar year, which integrated “Environment, 
Social & Governance” information with sustainability 
disclosures that are being implemented globally. 
On 1 January 2025, Australia’s mandatory climate disclosure 
regime took effect following the passage of the Treasury Laws 
Amendment (Financial Market Infrastructure and Other 
Measures) Act 2024 . The regime mandates disclosure of 
material climate-related financial risks and opportunities, 
metrics and targets, and information on governance, strategy 
and risk-management in accordance with Australian 
Sustainability Reporting Standards (“ASRS”) made by the 
Australian Accounting Standards Board (“AASB”): 
•AASB S2 Climate-related Disclosures – a mandatory 
Standard; and
•AASB S1 General Requirements for Disclosure of 
Sustainability-related Financial Information – a voluntary 
Standard. 
For Group 1 companies, including Yancoal, mandatory 
reporting of climate-related disclosures commences for 
financial years beginning on or after 1 January 2025.
AASB S1 and AASB S2 are aligned, as far as possible, to the 
International Sustainability Standards Board (“ISSB”) 
International Financial Reporting Standard (“IFRS”) S1 and 
IFRS S2. The main difference, when compared to the ISSB 
Standards, is that AASB S2 does not require the disclosure of 
industry-based metrics or the application of Sustainability 
Accounting Standards Board (“SASB”) disclosure topics.
Yancoal continues to undertake preparatory measures to ready 
the company for these mandatory disclosure requirements 
which will be reflected in its first sustainability report 
comprising of a climate statement and directors’ declaration for 
the 2025 financial year, prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Corporations Act 2001  (Cth) and AASB S2, 
and submitted to ASIC by 30 April 2026.
Yancoal’s 2024 Sustainability Report will continue the 
Company’s transition towards meeting AASB S2 Climate-
related Disclosures with the structure aligning to the approved 
Yancoal P4 Sustainability Framework, addressing the pillars of 
“people”, “planet”, “portfolio” and “profit”. As with previous 
years, Yancoal will continue to report against relevant 
disclosure standards, and where information is available, the 
report will incorporate relevant climate-related disclosures.SAFEGUARD MECHANISM
In 2016, the Government established a framework to establish 
safeguard facility “baselines” under the Safeguard Mechanism. 
This framework was later reformed in 2023 to progressively 
reduce safeguard facility baselines in line with Australia's 
emission reduction targets. These changes will require that the 
Company’s safeguard facilities purchase and retire “Australian 
Carbon Credit Units” (“ACCUs”) or “Safeguard Mechanism 
Credits” (“SMCs”) for emissions in excess of their declining 
baselines. This will impact the Company’s financial returns. The 
Company will continue to investigate abatement technologies 
to reduce emissions and thus the quantum of ACCUs which 
would otherwise be required. 
EMISSIONS
The Company acknowledges that it has a role to play in 
minimising the emissions generated by its operations and 
supporting research into low-emission technology to assist the 
reduction of downstream emissions from the consumption of 
coal products.
The transition to a lower carbon economy remains a critical 
element of mitigating the impacts of climate change.
Several state jurisdictions in Australia have also passed climate 
change legislation with more ambitious greenhouse gas 
(“GHG”) reduction targets than those contemplated under the 
federal legislation.
The establishment of jurisdiction specific GHG emission 
reduction targets can increase transition risks for the Company, 
as such jurisdiction specific targets may impact the relevant 
government’s approach to regulation of GHG emissions from 
mining facilities.
Yancoal also recognises that the federal government is due to 
submit an updated, and more ambitious , Nationally Determined 
Contribution for 2035 commitments under the Paris Agreement 
to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate 
Change Secretariat this year. 
Yancoal is investigating a possible pumped hydro power and 
solar facility at its Stratford mine. With coal production at the 
Stratford mine having been completed in the period, this 
renewable energy hub provides an excellent opportunity for the 
beneficial re-use of part of the site after cessation of mining, 
subject to both internal and external approval processes.
Yancoal continues to study the potential for nature-based 
ACCU Scheme projects across its property portfolio.
Equipment suppliers to the mining sector are constantly 
innovating to improve the fuel efficiency of haul trucks and 
other machinery. Fuel efficien cy is an important assessment 
metric Yancoal considers when acquiring equipment for its 
operations. 
Yancoal also understands the elevated interest from 
stakeholders regarding the potential risks and opportunities 
posed to its business and the broader sector due to the 
ongoing global shift towards a lower-carbon economy.
REPORTING
Yancoal reports its operational direct (“Scope 1”) and indirect 
(“Scope 2”) emissions annually in line with the National 
Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 (Cth).MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

The Group has implemented systems and processes to collect 
and calculate the data r equired and has submitted its

Emissions Intensity (tCO2-e/t 
ROM) 0.0475 0.0540  (12%) 
The increase in Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions was primarily 
driven by the 21% increase in ROM coal production from 
2022/2023 (“FY2023”) to FY2024.
FY2024 was the first year Yancoal’s assets were subject to the 
Australian Government’s 2023 amendments to the Safeguard 
Mechanism. Yancoal has an economic interest in six facilities 
with annual emissions above the 100,000 tonnes CO2-e 
Safeguard threshold - Ashton, Moolarben, Hunter Valley 
Operations, Middlemount, Warkworth and Yarrabee.
Following the completion of the FY2024 Section 19 NGER 
report, five facilities were confirmed to have exceeded their 
FY2024 scope 1 baselines. These facilities are Ashton, Hunter 
Valley Operations, Middlemount, Warkworth and Yarrabee. As 
Moolarben’s scope 1 emissions were below its Safeguard 
baseline, this resulted in the site generating SMCs. 
SMCs can be used to offset carbon emissions in future or 
traded with other Safeguard facilities.
ENVIRONMENT
Yancoal’s operations are subject to stringent environmental 
approvals and licences. To enhance compliance with these 
regulatory obligations, and to meet the requirements of 
Yancoal’s management directives, Yancoal has developed and 
implemented comprehensive and robust environmental 
compliance systems, processes and practices. These systems, 
processes and practices are subject to continuous 
improvement initiatives and are periodically audited by third 
parties to provide “third line” assurance to the Board and the 
HSEC Committee regarding both systems and performance. In 
addition, Yancoal continuously monitors legislative and policy 
changes to allow sufficient time to implement environmental 
licensing and management changes in response to policy 
reform.
The following practices continue to be deployed as an 
additional review for matters of Aborigin al Cultural Heritage 
(“ACH”) and environmental risk management respectively:
•Yancoal continues to implement its corporate Aboriginal 
Cultural Heritage Management Standard. This Standard sets 
out minimum requirements for managing ACH to ensure that 
all sites are consistently implementing control measures to 
minimise the impacts of mining on ACH.•Yancoal’s Independent Environmental Assurance Audit 
(“IEAA”) program is designed to assess the risks associated 
with key environmental aspects at each operation. During 
2024, audits were completed at Ashton, Austar and MTW. 
The level of environmental management demonstrated by 
these sites has been found to be effective, with some 
“opportunities for improvement” identified to improve 
environmental performance further.
SOCIAL
Yancoal is committed to making a genuine positive difference 
in the communities in which it operates. Yancoal operates a 
Community Support Program (“CSP”) which proactively 
engages with stakeholders at each site to support local and 
regional initiatives.
In 2024, Yancoal contributed $2.1 million via the CSP to 
environmental, education, arts, culture and community 
initiatives, $0.9 million of which was managed by sites and 
directed into local communities.
Yancoal also works with its community stakeholders, utilising 
community consultative committees, local newsletters, local 
media, community days and site-specific websites to ensure 
communities are engaged and informed of relevant matters 
related to nearby operations.
Yancoal’s Code of Conduct, Anti-Corruption and Sanctions 
Policy set out the Group’s requirements and expectations for all 
employees and suppliers, including the requirement to act 
ethically at all times. Further details including related policies 
are set out in the Corporate Governance Statement.
Yancoal is required to submit an annual modern slavery 
statement under the Modern Slavery Act 2018 (Cth)  and has 
developed procedures to ensure its suppliers are not engaging 
in modern slavery. The annual statements are available on the 
Company’s website.
GOVERNANCE
Yancoal has developed governance processes to drive its 
Sustainability performance across the business. The Enterprise 
Risk Management framework is a key platform and includes the 
assessment and mitigation of material business risks, including 
social and environmental risks and the risks associated with 
climate change and the progressive transition to a lower 
carbon economy. The HSEC Committee Charter includes 
oversight of compliance with modern slavery regulations as a 
responsibility of the HSEC Committee. This will further increase 
the governance and supervision of Yancoal's modern slavery 
risk.
The Board has ultimate responsibility for the oversight and 
approval of risk management and financial investment 
decisions, including those relating to climate change.  MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS
3245 Emissions data is reported on 100% basis, but Yancoal does not own 100% of all assets. The operating assets included are: Moolarben, Mount Thorley , Warkworth, Yarrabee and 
Ashton, as well as several non-operational assets. Reporting on a 100% basis is consistent with the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (“NGER”) data submitted to the Clean 
Energy Regulator (“CER”).
