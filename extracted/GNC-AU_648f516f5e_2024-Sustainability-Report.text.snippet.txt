FY24 highlights
Financial
We delivered a resilient 
financial result in  FY24 amid  
mixed  Australian growing 
conditions and a weaker 
global  margin environment. 
Operational
Our people and assets performed 
strongly during the year with 
continued emphasis on  driving 
efficiencies across  our integrated 
value chain.
 
Sustainability
We continued delivering on 
our sustainability goals and 
recorded improvements in several 
key metrics across the business.  
Intensity metrics are measured per  unit of 
production/throughput tonne. They are  influenced 
by fluctuations in the annual volume of grain 
handled by GrainCorp, which is directly correlated 
to the size of the East Coast Australia harvest. 1. Underlying EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure representing earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, excluding Business Transformation costs.
2. Underlying NPAT is a non ‑IFRS measure representing statutory net profit after tax, excluding Business costs after  tax.

Message from the Chair of the  
Board Sustainability Committee and  
the Managing Director and CEO
We are pleased to present the 
Sustainability Report for  FY24. 
Having spent the previous three 
years building capability within our 
business across ESG topics, our 
work in FY24 represents a tangible  
shift to action, and this year has been 
an excellent one in terms of progress 
in sustainability at GrainCorp.
Our commitment to sustainability encompasses a constant 
and enduring focus on the health, safety and wellbeing of 
our people. “We Stay Safe” is a core value at GrainCorp and 
we are pleased to see a 13.8 per cent reduction in our RIFR 
this year, supported by a focus on critical risks and safety 
leadership. Operational activities vary across GrainCorp 
sites, with each activity posing differing safety risks. Raising 
awareness of these risks and the opportunities to improve 
our operations and mitigate those risks, is critical to our 
safety performance and FY24 saw a three ‑fold increase  
in hazard reporting across our business. More details of 
our safety performance and the safety initiatives we have 
undertaken during the  year can be found on  page 51.Against the background of growing global demand for 
transparency and standardisation in the reporting of 
sustainability related risks and opportunities, the Australian 
Sustainability Reporting Standards (ASRS)  will take effect  
on 1 January 2025. Identifying, prioritising and managing  
climate -related risks and opportunities is integral to the 
climate resilience of our business. GrainCorp began 
implementing the recommendations of the Taskforce on 
Climate‑related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in FY21 and  
we continue to build the necessary capabilities into our 
finance, risk, and strategy functions in preparation for the 
comprehensive climate disclosure required under the ASRS. 
More information on our approach to Climate can be found 
on page 24.
A key focus for  FY24 was the development of emissions  
reduction targets, that underpin the actions required 
to support the global ambition to limit global warming 
to 1.5 degrees above pre‑industrial levels. Our  targets 
have been developed in line with the science -based 
targets initiative (SBTi), and we aim to submit a complete  
set of targets to SBTi for  validation in  late 2024.  
We look forward to providing a further update in  FY25.This year we also built on our existing capabilities in renewable 
fuels and Animal Nutrition, two areas of GrainCorp’s strategy 
that provide strong climate‑related opportunities. In July,  
GrainCorp entered a Memorandum of Understanding with 
global fund managers IFM Investors and with Ampol, Australia’s 
largest transport energy provider, to explore the creation of 
an integrated renewable fuels industry in Australia. We believe 
an Australian renewable fuel refining industry will support the 
decarbonisation of the hard -to-abate transport fuel sector 
while building a valuable new domestic market for Australian 
growers and feedstock producers.

Message from the Chair of the Board Sustainability Committee  
and the Managing Director and CEO
In April 2024, we expanded our  Animal Feeds business  
through the acquisition of Performance Feeds and Nutrition 
Service Australia. This acquisition adds to our portfolio 
of innovative feed solutions and allows us to scale up the 
production of sustainable feeds to drive sustainable growth 
and innovation in the animal nutrition sector. More information 
on these initiatives can  be found on  pages 31 and 32.
In October this year, we launched GrainCorp Next, a 
sustainable agriculture initiative to build an end -to-end 
low carbon emission supply chain and support the 
decarbonisation of Australian grains and oilseeds supply. 
Demonstrating the sustainability credentials of agricultural 
commodities is becoming a vital factor in accessing key 
export markets. Currently, the Australian agricultural industry 
lacks consistent and accessible tools for measuring on -farm 
sustainability impacts, including emissions, and GrainCorp 
Next aims to develop a solution to these challenges. Initially, 
the initiative will focus on canola, a low emissions crop 
that is highly integrated with GrainCorp’s operations from 
handling to seed crush and oil refining. GrainCorp Next is an 
excellent example of our commitment to develop sustainable 
solutions in a changing market and we encourage you to 
read more about this multi‑year  initiative on  pages 34 and 35.  
Intertwined with the work we are doing to manage 
climate -related risks and opportunities, is our developing 
approach to nature. As a key interface between Australian 
landowners and government -led nature regulation, 
GrainCorp aims to take a proactive role in developing an 
aligned approach to managing this important issue. We were 
active participants in the Federal Government’s inaugural 
Global Nature Positive Summit and in the Nature Positive 
Roundtable, convened by the Australian Climate and 
Biodiversity Foundation, which aims to collaborate on key 
issues essential to the creation of a nature positive economy. 
More information on the climate and nature related industry 
forums we prioritise can be found on page 36.Enhancing the employee experience remains an ongoing 
priority at GrainCorp and we are committed to creating 
and maintaining a balanced, diverse, inclusive culture. 
The launch of GrainCorp’s Innovate level RAP in February, 
following full endorsement from Reconciliation Australia, has 
seen overwhelming support from GrainCorp employees and 
stakeholders across Australia and we are immensely proud 
to be the first Australian agribusiness to launch a RAP at 
this level. More detail on the actions we have taken under 
our RAP can  be found on page 65.  
In February 2024, the Workplace  Gender Equality Agency  
(WGEA) published the median  gender pay gaps of private  
sector employers with 100 or  more employees. GrainCorp’s  
median base salary gender pay gap was 2.7 per  cent and  
median total remuneration  gender pay gap was 0.3 per  cent, 
the smallest of any ASX 200 company. This achievement  
is the outcome of targeted and deliberate actions taken 
over the preceding four years and is a demonstration of the 
importance GrainCorp places on our people and on diversity.
We are now into the third year of operation of the GrainCorp 
Community Foundation  (GCF). The GCF demonstrates the  
ways in which our people and our business support our 
local communities and get behind our value “We Care”. 
We are delighted to have the opportunity to make a positive 
impact through our corporate partnerships, community 
grants, sponsorships and silo art projects. We are especially 
proud of the contribution our people have made, through 
community volunteering, to meaningful charities and causes 
such as Royal Far West, Soul Hub, Ronald McDonald House, 
Meals with Impact and OzHarvest.GrainCorp’s sustainability achievements in  FY24, represent a  
clear shift to action. As we look to FY25, it is vital we maintain  
momentum and rise to the opportunity and the responsibility 
created by GrainCorp’s unique position in the agricultural 
supply chain, in our regional communities and in our industry. 
Together with our Board and Committee and Executive Team 
colleagues, we are excited to launch GrainCorp Next and 
continue to drive towards sustainable solutions for our business 
and our industry, in  FY25 and beyond.
