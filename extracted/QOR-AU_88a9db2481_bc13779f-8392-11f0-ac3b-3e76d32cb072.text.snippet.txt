Report
 
2025
 
 
The
 
digital
 
world,
 
of
 
which
 
Qoria
 
is
 
a
 
part,
 
is
 
moving
 
at
 
an
 
increasingly
 
fast
 
pace.
 
With
 
this
 
comes
 
greater
 
risks
 
in
 
cybersecurity
 
and
 
data
 
privacy,
 
two
 
key
 
elements
 
of
 
global
 
ESG
 
frameworks.
 
Qoria’s
 
business,
 
products
 
and
 
services
 
have
 
ESG
 
at
 
their
 
heart.
 
 
This
 
annual
 
sustainability
 
report
 
aims
 
to
 
increase
 
transparency
 
and
 
communicate
 
the
 
impact
 
we
 
 
make
 
as
 
a
 
company.
 
By
 
better
 
understanding,
 
managing
 
and
 
disclosing
 
our
 
impact,
 
we
 
can
 
enhance
 
decision-making,
 
reduce
 
risks,
 
identify
 
business
 
opportunities
 
and
 
strengthen
 
stakeholder
 
relationships.
 
This
 
report
 
outlines
 
the
 
results
 
of
 
this
 
work.
 
It
 
identiﬁes
 
Qoria’s
 
key

to
 
Qoria
 
and
 
establishes
 
an
 
initial
 
suite
 
of
 
measures
 
for
 
driving
 
ongoing
 
action.The
 
success
 
of
 
our
 
business
 
relies
 
on
 
strong,
 
effective
 
and
 
long-lasting
 
relationships
 
with
 
our
 
stakeholders.

For
 
the
 
purposes
 
of
 
this
 
report,
 
Qoria
 
has
 
drawn
 
on
 
disclosure
 
guidance
 
from
 
two
 
leading
 
global
 
standards:
 
Global
 
Reporting
 
Initiative
 
(GRI)
 
standards
 
and
 
the
 
SASB
 
standards,
 
along
 
with
 
peers
 
and
 
common
 
industry
 
disclosures.
 
This
 
report
 
incorporates
 
the
 
GRI
 
principles
 
of
 
organisational
 
context,
 
structure
 
and
 
materiality
 
assessment
 
and
 
prioritisation.
 
As
 
our
 
ESG
 
capacity
 
matures,
 
we
 
will
 
expand
 
disclosures
 
across
 
our
 
environmental,
 
social
 
and
 
governance
 
impact
 
areas.
 
 
We
 
recognise
 
that
 
pursuing
 
common
 
global
 
frameworks
 
empowers
 
the
 
global
 
community
 
to
 
work
 
towards
 
common
 
goals.
 
As
 
such,
 
we
 
see
 
ourselves
 
as

Qoria
 
recognises
 
that
 
while
 
climate
 
change
 
is
 
a
 
serious
 
challenge
 
for
 
society
 
at
 
large,
 
it
 
also
 
could
 
have
 
direct
 
impact
 
on
 
our
 
communities,
 
as
 
well
 
as
 
our
 
operations.
 
This
 
includes
 
extreme
 
weather,
 
supply
 
chain
 
disruption,
 
compliance
 
with
 
emerging
 
climate-related
 
regulations,
 
policies
 
and
 
laws.
 
 
We
 
have
 
an

to
 
play
 
in
 
ensuring
 
responsible

Qoria
 
is
 
investing
 
in
 
world
 
leading
 
cloud
 
sustainability.
 
Our
 
most
 
signiﬁcant
 
environmental
 
footprint
 
is
 
in
 
the
 
cloud
 
data
 
and
 
hosting
 
services
 
procured
 
from
 
third
 
party
 
cloud
 
providers
 
such
 
as
 
Google
 
Cloud
 
Platform
 
(GCP),
 
Amazon
 
Web
 
Service
 
(AWS)
 
and
 
Microsoft
 
Azure.
 
 
Qoria
 
has
 
an
 
ongoing
 
strategic
 
partnership
 
with
 
GCP,
 
which
 
has
 
strong
 
sustainability
 
and
 
environmental
 
credentials.
 
Google
 
has
 
set
 
ambitious
 
targets
 
to
 
achieve
 
net-zero
 
emissions
 
across
 
their
 
operations
 
and
 
value
 
chain
 
by
 
2030
 
and
 
reduce
 
50%
 
of

absolute
 
emissions
 
(compared
 
to
 
their
 
2019
 
base
 
year)
 
by
 
2030.
 
Google
 
also
 
plans
 
to
 
invest
 
in
 
nature
 
and
 
technology-driven
 
carbon
 
removal
 
solutions
 
to
 
neutralise
 
remaining
 
emissions.
 
Qoria
 
continues
 
to
 
actively
 
migrate
 
workloads
 
out
 
of
 
other
 
cloud
 
platforms
 
and
 
into
 
GCP,
 
and
 
by
 
doing
 
so,
 
we
 
are
 
improving
 
our
 
emissions
 
visibility
 
and
 
ensuring
 
that
 
our
 
workloads
 
are
 
taking
 
advantage
 
of
 
Google’s
 
world
 
leading
 
emissions
 
reduction
 
targets.

Qoria
 
continues
 
to
 
scale
 
across
 
key

and
 
strengthen
 
its
 
product
 
suite,
 
including
 
through
 
the
 
strategic
 
acquisition
 
of
 
Octopus
 
BI.
 
Despite
 
this
 
expansion,
 
we
 
achieved
 
a
 
46%
 
reduction
 
in
 
total
 
carbon
 
emissions
 
compared
 
to
 
the
 
previous
 
year,
 
reﬂecting
 
our
 
commitment
 
to
 
sustainable
 
growth.
 
Our
 
cloud
 
infrastructure,
 
primarily
 
hosted
 
on
 
Google
 
Cloud
 
Platform
 
(GCP),
 
accounts
 
for
 
91%
 
of
 
our
 
overall
 
emissions
 
footprint.
 
GCP’s
 
ongoing
 
investment
 
in
 
clean
 
energy
 
has
 
supported
 
our
 
emissions
 
reduction
 
efforts,
 
with
 
its
 
platform-speciﬁc
 
emissions
 
declining
 
by
 
50%,
 
a
 
sharper
 
reduction
 
than
 
observed
 
across
 
our
 
other
 
cloud
 
partners.
