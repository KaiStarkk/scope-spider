IT system failure and cyber security risks
Any information technology system is potentially vulnerable to interruption and/or damage from several sources, including but not 
limited to computer viruses, cyber security attacks and other security breaches, power, systems, internet and data network failures, and 
natural disasters. The Group is committed to preventing and reducing cyber security risks through ongoing management of the risks and 
continuous review.
 
Climate related
There may be climate related factors which impact the Group's operations in both the near and longer term. For example, these impacts 
could be in areas such as availability and cost of materials used in the Group’s products or manufacturing processes, transport, and/or 
occurrence of extreme weather events. Any significant or sustained impacts could adversely affect the Group’s financial performance 
and/or financial position. The Group has begun developing a comprehensive Scopes 1 & 2 Emissions Inventory in line with the 
Greenhouse Gas Protocol, integrating management and reduction strategies across all sites to meet reporting obligations. Sources of 
emissions for Scope 3 will also be identified, with ESG reporting to commence in the 2027 Annual Report.
 
Significant changes in the state of affairs
There were no significant changes in the state of affairs of the Group during the financial year.
 
Matters subsequent to the end of the financial year
Subsequent to the end of the financial year, the Group successfully negotiated an extension of its existing banking facility with National 
Australia Bank. As disclosed in note 28, the revised terms include an extension of the maturity date (no bank bills maturing in FY 2026), 
with all other material terms remaining substantially unchanged.
 
Apart from the facility extension and the dividend declared as discussed above, no other matter or circumstance has arisen since 30 June 
2025 that has significantly affected, or may significantly affect the Group's operations, the results of those operations, or the Group's 
state of affairs in future financial years.
 
Likely developments and expected results of operations
The Group enters FY2026 with a leaner cost base, enhanced operational discipline, and clearly defined strategic priorities. While 
residential market activity remained subdued throughout FY2025, early indicators point to a modest recovery emerging in the first half 
of FY2026. Expectations of lower interest rates, ongoing housing demand, and continued government stimulus are anticipated to support 
a gradual rebound in residential construction activity over the course of the year.
 
The commercial segment remains comparatively resilient, supported by consistent demand and a solid pipeline of projects expected to 
continue into FY2026. The Group will maintain its strategic focus on growing market share in differentiated product categories, including 
lightweight cladding, engineered timber, and premium decorative panels. These segments continue to gain traction and remain central 
to the Group’s long-term market positioning.
 
Supply chain enhancements delivered in FY2025, including improved procurement capability, strengthened supplier relationships, and 
more efficient logistics execution have better positioned the Group to manage volatility and respond to evolving customer needs. These 
improvements are expected to continue supporting cost control and operational efficiency throughout FY2026.
 
Queensland remains the Group’s strongest performing and fastest-growing market, underpinned by robust construction activity and 
infrastructure investment linked to the 2032 Brisbane Olympics. The Group's significant presence in the state provides a strong platform 
to capitalise on this demand. While conditions in New South Wales and Victoria remain soft, some early signs of stabilisation emerged 
in late FY2025. The New Zealand market continues to face headwinds.
 
Although near-term market conditions remain uncertain, the Group is well positioned to benefit from a recovery in residential markets 
and continued stability in commercial activity. The Group’s diversified geographic footprint, focus on trade-aligned segments, and 
commitment to higher-margin product categories provide a solid foundation for sustainable growth over the medium term.
 
Environmental regulation
The Group is not subject to any significant environmental regulation under Australian Commonwealth or State law.
