EXECUTIVE COMMENTARY 
AT THE MICHAEL HILL GROUP, 
SUSTAINABILITY IS NOT JUST A 
COMMITMENT - IT’S A CORE PART OF 
WHO WE ARE AND HOW WE OPERATE. 
THIS YEAR’S ESG REPORT REFLECTS THE 
EVOLUTION OF OUR APPROACH AND 
THE IMPORTANCE OF TRANSPARENCY IN 
EVERYTHING WE DO.
You’ll notice a change in the name of this report. As we 
prepare for Australia’s first mandatory climate reporting 
period in FY26, we’ve renamed this publication our ‘ESG 
Report’ to distinguish this voluntary reporting from the 
mandatory Sustainability Report that will be included 
in our FY26 Annual Report. Our continued commitment 
to voluntary reporting is essential for accountability of 
delivering our 2030 Sustainability Strategy goals.
We are also aligning the cadence of our ESG reporting with 
our goals, shifting to a calendar year cycle in future. This 
change will allow us to report more meaningful ESG updates 
to stakeholders on progress against our 2030 goals. Our 
next ESG Report will cover the period from July 2025 to 
December 2026 and will be published in early 2027.

20  |  MICHAEL HILL INTERNATIONAL LIMITED  |  ESG REPORT 2025REDUCE, REPLACE, OFFSET STRATEGY 
Emissions from electricity use across our store network and 
head office locations make up the largest part of emissions 
from our own operations. As a result, we followed a ‘Reduce, 
Replace, Offset’ strategy to support our net zero goal. 
Reduce
This year, we introduced LED lighting across an additional  
8% of our store network, with 89% of our stores now running 
on LED lighting. We have committed to installing LED lighting 
in the remaining stores as part of our regular refit works. 
To further reduce energy consumption, our instore digital 
display screens have been programmed to automatically 
power down outside of trading hours, eliminating 
unnecessary electricity use across the store network.
PERFORMANCE SNAPSHOT
•  79% reduction in scope 1 and 2 emissions across 
the Group compared to last financial year
•  Achieved a 5-star energy rating for our Global 
Support Centre base building
•  Generated 131mWh through our Global Support 
Centre’s rooftop solar systemZERO CARBON OPERATIONS
We will achieve net zero carbon operations  
(scope 1 and 2) by 2025. PLANET PILLAR
Replace
The Global Support Centre building operates a 99KW rooftop 
solar panel system. This year, we generated 131mWh 
through solar, covering 18% of our electricity requirements. 
For our other sites across Australia and New Zealand, we 
procured green energy solutions that directly support local 
renewable energy generation. 
This year, we transitioned the energy supply for 87 stores 
in Australia and the remaining 2 stores in New Zealand to 
zero emission sources that support 100% renewable energy 
generation. This meant all electricity consumed by our 
stores and support office locations in Australia and New 
Zealand was matched with accredited renewable electricity.

=== Page 21 ===
21  |  MICHAEL HILL INTERNATIONAL LIMITED  |  ESG REPORT 2025AUSTRALIAN RENEWABLES
To achieve our goal in Australia, we voluntarily purchase 
GreenPower and surrender renewable energy generation 
certificates (LGCs) to match our electricity use above 
Australia’s Renewable Power Percentage (RPP). The RPP is 
the portion of electricity that the Clean Energy Regulator 
(CER) requires to be from renewable sources under the 
Renewable Energy Target. The RPP was 18.48% for 2024 
and 17.91% for 2025. This ensures that, in addition to 
the national renewable baseline, we are supporting extra 
renewable energy generation in Australia.
GreenPower is a government-accredited product designed 
to support renewable energy generation. LGCs are created 
through projects such as wind and solar farms and are 
surrendered on our behalf to the CER. 
NEW ZEALAND RENEWABLES
To achieve our goal in New Zealand, we voluntarily purchase 
and redeem New Zealand Energy Certificates (NZ-ECs) via 
the New Zealand Energy Certificate System. These NZ-ECs 
are equivalent to 100% of our electricity use, ensuring 
that our consumption is matched with certified renewable 
energy generated in New Zealand. This year, our purchases 
directly supported renewables at a wind farm in the South 
Island and a solar farm in the North Island. 
These products mean the amount of electricity used from 
the grid in Australia and New Zealand is matched with 
electricity produced from certified renewable sources. 
This allows the Group to report our market-based scope 
2 electricity emissions as zero, using the market-based 
methodology as per the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance. 
CANADIAN RENEWABLES
This year, we developed plans to purchase renewable 
energy for our Canadian store network. We identified a 
renewable energy certificate (REC) provider in Canada and 
intend to purchase Ecologo certified RECs that meet strict 
environmental standards to match our electricity usage to 
reach our net zero goal. 
Offset
While our Replace initiatives address electricity-related 
emissions, some operational emissions remain. These 
represent a small portion of our total footprint and will  
be offset through certified carbon credits aligned with  
our nature restoration goals. 
We plan to procure these offsets in January 2026,  
once our 2025 consumption data is reconciled.
Reduce, Replace Offset in action
This year, the base building of our Global Support  
Centre achieved a 5-star Energy rating and 4.5-star  
Water rating from National Australian Built Environment 
Rating System (NABERS). 
The combination of our onsite renewable electricity 
generation, purchase of renewable electricity products  
and rainwater tanks enabled us to retain these NABERS 
scores for the 2024/25 period. PLANET PILLAR

22  |  MICHAEL HILL INTERNATIONAL LIMITED  |  ESG REPORT 2025OUR EMISSIONS PROFILE
Our emissions identification and calculations are in 
accordance with the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol, 
as required by the Australian Sustainability Reporting 
Standards (ASRS). 
We have used the operational control approach to 
determine the organisational boundary for the Group’s 
emissions inventory. All sites and assets under our  
direct operational control are included within our  
reporting boundary. 
This includes all Michael Hill and Bevilles stores across 
Australia, New Zealand and Canada, Michael Hill 
and Bevilles support office locations (including the 
manufacturing and distribution centre and repairs site) in 
Brisbane, and the Michael Hill support office in Auckland. 
The emissions boundary is aligned with the Group for 
financial reporting purposes.TOTAL CARBON EMISSIONS

This year, our emissions inventory includes: 
Scope 1: Direct emissions from refrigerants used 
in air conditioning units and fridges and gas used in 
manufacturing and repairs facilities.
Scope 2: Indirect emissions from purchased electricity  
and heating, calculated using both location-based and 
market-based methodologies. Our total location-based 
emissions have increased 6% on last year due to a higher 
electricity usage mix in Australia over the past year (with  
a higher average grid emissions intensity) compared  
with New Zealand and Canada. 
In addition, we have included further store heating data 
this year as we continue to work with Canadian landlords to 
improve data integrity.
ACHIEVING OUR 2025 TARGET
In preparation for mandatory reporting under ASRS and 
to align with the GHG Protocol preferred approach, we 
have made minor revisions to our emissions calculation 
methodologies. Prior year emissions have been restated 
as a result (the changes between previously reported 
emissions and restated emissions are not material).  
We have also included store-based refrigeration and air 
conditioning units in our emissions inventory if the units  
are under our direct operational control.
Very occasionally, actual usage of electricity and heating 
was not available from supplier invoice data. Where 
necessary, we have estimated consumption based on 
average consumption for sites of a similar size and location 
to ensure completeness, accuracy and comparability.  OUR TARGET:  
NET ZERO SCOPE 1 & 2

23  |  MICHAEL HILL INTERNATIONAL LIMITED  |  ESG REPORT 2025Scope 3
Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions from our value 
chain. They occur outside of the Group’s organisational 
boundary but as a result of our actions. This year, we 
conducted an initial assessment of the scope 3 emissions 
categories most relevant to the Group through a review of 
our value chain. The preliminary assessment, supported 
by industry benchmarking analysis, identified the specific 
upstream and downstream activities where our indirect 
emissions are likely to be most significant. We expect 
purchased goods and services (category 1) and upstream 
transportation and distribution (category 4) to comprise 
most of our scope 3 emissions inventory. 
Additional relevant categories include capital goods, 
fuel- and energy-related activities not included in scope 1 
or 2, waste generated in operations, business travel and 
employee commuting. This initial identification provides the 
foundation for more detailed analysis, quantification and 
proactive supplier engagement over the coming year.

“ We are delighted to have achieved a 79% reduction in our  
scope 1 and 2 emissions across the Group this year - a 
tremendous milestone on our journey to net zero. Through 
dedicated efforts and investment in green energy across our 
operations in Australia and New Zealand, we are making tangible 
progress towards our 2025 goal. I am proud of what our team 
has accomplished and we remain committed to leading positive

BEYOND 2025
We are on track to achieve our net zero carbon operations 
(scope 1 and 2) goal by the end of the calendar year.  
We will publish an updated Zero Carbon Emissions goal  
in early 2026. 
Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards
This year, we have taken steps to ensure the Group’s 
successful transition under the ASRS. 
We have developed a climate reporting roadmap and 
remain on track to meet our reporting obligations for 
FY26. We have identified key climate-related risks and 
opportunities, integrated climate risk into our broader  
risk management processes, confirmed climate scenarios 
and started scenario analysis.
