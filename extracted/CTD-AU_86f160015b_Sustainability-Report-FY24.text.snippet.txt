On behalf of the Board, we welcome you to CTM’s 
Sustainability Report for FY24, where we outline progress 
against our sustainability strategy and targets. 
CTM is committed to the long-term sustainability of our business 
and has developed a sustainability strategy that encompasses 
factors we believe will support our long-term success. These 
include the ways we interact with our people, customers and 
shareholders; how we reduce our impact on the environment; 
and support the communities in which we operate.
We are on a mission to be travel management leaders in all 
regions in which we operate, using innovative technology 
to improve our customers’ experiences and bring positive 
change to the market. As a business imperative, we are 
driving improvement in our sustainability efforts and looking 
to show progress every year.
This year, we have seen significant evolution in the 
sustainability landscape and an increase in stakeholder 
expectations globally. Our customers, investors, regulators, 
employees and suppliers have made clear to us the 
importance that they place on sustainability- especially 
sustainable travel.
Key improvements CTM has delivered this year
CTM’s sustainability strategy is based on four pillars; 
governance, planet, people and prosperity. This year, our 
key focus has been to ensure our foundations are strong 
and frameworks are in place to support and deliver on key 
commitments. 
We have managed CTM’s sustainability risks and 
opportunities through:
 •A refreshed materiality matrix to ensure the sustainability 
topics most important to our stakeholders are our priority.
 •A gap analysis that prepares CTM for mandatory climate-
related reporting compliance.
 •A review of the climate impact assessment to ensure 
it aligns with the broader business’s risk management 
framework.
 •Scrutiny of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including 
Scope 3 boundary, emissions factors, calculation basis, 
and a third-party verification of our GHG inventory.
We reduced CTM’s environmental impact by: 
 •Embedding CTM’s decarbonisation plan, the Climate 
(net) Positive Program.
 •Achieving 20% renewable source energy for our offices. 
 •Rationalising the office footprint, seeking energy 
efficiencies and better sustainability credentials in new 
tenancy procurement.Throughout the year, we have improved our products to 
help customers reduce the impact of their business travel 
and meet their sustainability goals, including reporting 
obligations and decarbonisation efforts. 
Lastly, we are very proud to have a thriving work 
environment that celebrates diverse experiences and 
perspectives, empowers employees to achieve their 
full potential, and ensures equitable rewards for their 
contributions. 
Looking ahead
The next stage in our sustainability strategy is to prepare 
for mandatory climate-related reporting by enhancing 
our data collection processes, governance structure, risk 
management and strategy. 
Last year, we had planned to make more progress with our 
renewable energy target, however, due to circumstances 
beyond our control needed to meet the target, it has 
prompted us to reconsider our ambition. For the year ahead 
we expect to make more progress, but we have recalibrated 
this target to reflect more measured expectations. 
We thank our customers, employees, investors and all 
our stakeholders for their support, and we look forward to 
delivering value and achieving our commitments into 2025 
and beyond.

Mitigating Climate 
Change
We have updated our Climate Impact Assessment using 
the risks that are material to the organisation across a short 
to medium term. Where action may be needed by CTM or 
suppliers, we prepare mitigation strategies for these risks in 
our business planning. These mitigation strategies can be 
viewed in the Climate Risk Assessment.
We are preparing for mandatory climate-related reporting 
under the Australian Government’s legislation: Treasury Laws 
Amendment (Financial Market Infrastructure and Other 
Measures) Bill 2024. We will review our climate-related risk 
framework and mitigations in FY25.A Climate (net) Positive Program was published in FY23, 
to support CTM’s delivery and reporting on mitigation 
strategies and to meet customer expectations regarding 
decarbonisation.
Climate (net) Positive Program
CTM’s Climate (net) Positive Program outlines the key 
climate-related targets and mitigation initiatives for 
reducing Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions in the short and 
medium term. This plan is the foundation for mitigating 
CTM’s climate impact.
