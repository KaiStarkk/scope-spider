Reserve energy capacity
We can support a more resilient energy grid
by managing our demand for power to draw
"electricity from the grid when it is stable, and"
switch to backup power when the grid is at risk
of becoming overloaded.
We can do this by switching to our ‘reserve capacity’ when
we become aware of an urgent need to reduce pressure
on the grid. This can also help us draw more power when
