In June 2025, we helped supercharge the 
fundraising power of hundreds of community 
causes by adding the 50-50 Foundation’s Play 
For Purpose charity raffle to The Lott’s digital 
channels.  
Being able to purchase Play For Purpose tickets 
directly on The Lott website and app provides 
more ways for customers to participate while 
supporting their charities of choice. 
In addition, they can buy Play For Purpose tickets 
in the same transaction as their favourite lottery 
games marking a new era of our customers 
giving back while being in the running to win 
great prizes.

(i)     Early intervention means attempting to contact or intervene in a registered customer’s play experience after detecting material changes in customer play behaviour for the purpose of 
offering responsible gambling support.
(ii)    Completion of audits was impacted by factors including lack of accessibility due to natural disasters, remoteness of location, temporary closures and/or scheduling. To address these 
issues, The Lottery Corporation has established a working group to review and enhance our current venue and outlet survey process.11 | The Lottery Corporation — 2025 Sustainability Report   | 11 Introduction Governance Responsibility Community Our People Environment

Our Net Zero ambition
In June 2025, we developed new targets to reduce 
greenhouse gas emissions, with our intention to 
deliver net zero Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas 
emissions by 2030.
Our Net Zero Roadmap outlines our proposed path 
to achieve this, with key opportunities including:
• Continued transition of our fleet to largely 
hybrid vehicles
• Procuring renewable electricity or large 
generation certificates (LGCs) for our offices and 
distribution centres
• Procuring high-quality offsets where we cannot 
reduce or abate emissions.
We recognise that operating a responsible business 
includes optimising our use of natural resources, and 
reducing our impact on the environment.
While our emissions footprint is small in comparison 
to Australia’s other larger companies by market 
capitalisation, our business and value chain does 
have an impact on the environment and we are 
taking action to reduce our environmental footprint.
In FY25, we developed our Net Zero Roadmap 
and commenced a climate-related risk and 
opportunity assessment.
In FY26, we intend to:
• Continue to strengthen our approach to climate 
related disclosures, in line with the requirements of 
the Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards S2 
Climate-related Disclosures issued by the Australian 
Accounting Standards Board
• Commence implementation of our Net Zero 
Roadmap, focusing initially on operational emissions 
(Scope 1 & 2).

Scope 1 and 2 emissions
Our main source of Scope 1 emissions is transport 
fuel. We operate a fleet of 52 vehicles used primarily 
by our Channel team when engaging with retailers 
across our network. The fleet consists of sedans 
and small and large sport utility vehicles that use 
both diesel and petrol fuel, including hybrid vehicles, 
which currently comprise more than 40% of our total 
fleet. Total vehicle fuel consumption was 116,511 litres 
in FY25.
Our main source of Scope 2 emissions related to 
electricity consumption at our five corporate offices, 
two warehouse sites and one concept store, with all 
electricity currently sourced from the grid. 
Our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions(i) decreased 
relative to FY24, due to a slight reduction in both fuel 
and electricity consumption, and improvements in 
location-based electricity emissions factors across 
all states.
Scope 3 emissions
Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions that occur 
in our value chain both upstream and downstream 
and comprise more than 97% of our overall 
emissions profile.
We estimated our total Scope 3 emissions to be 39,787 
tonnes CO2-e(i) in FY25.FY23 FY25Electricity consumption

Powering up the future
As part of our commitment to achieving net zero 
Scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, The 
Lottery Corporation has begun trialling electric 
vehicles (EVs) within our operational fleet. This 
initiative complements our ongoing transition to 
hybrid vehicles.  
The E V trial will help us evaluate vehicle performance, charging infrastructure 
requirements, overall impact on our operational 
footprint, and benefits and challenges of 
incorporating fully electric models into our 
business. Insights gained from this trial will 
inform our broader fleet strategy and support 
the scaling up of zero and low-emission 
transport solutions as we transition to a lower-
carbon economy.(i)    The Lottery Corporation’s emissions inventory has been prepared in line 
with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting 
Standard (2004) and Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Value Chain 
(Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard (2011)46 | The Lottery Corporation — 2025 Sustainability Report   | 46
