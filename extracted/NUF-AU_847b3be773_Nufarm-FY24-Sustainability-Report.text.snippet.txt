People
Our long-term strategic goals rely on the dedication, creativity 
and resilience of our employees across the world.
Safety is our highest priority and we strive to improve our 
approach and achieve better outcomes. We have dedicated 
programs to address process safety management, personal 
safety and wellbeing. Our objective is that 'everyone goes 
home safely' every day—whether they are working in the 
manufacturing plants, out on the road, or in the field meeting 
with our customers. Our wellness program is available to all 
employees and provides support to our employees and their 
family members.
In FY24, we saw 6 of our 11 crop protection manufacturing 
sites achieve a lost time injury (LTI) free year. Despite these 
milestone achievements, our overall rate of injury remained on 
an upward trend, due to injuries that occurred in the first six 
months of the year. In the last six months of FY24 we saw an 
improvement in safety performance and we remain ever vigilant 
to the risks that could see this more recent trend reverse. The 
Serious Injury Frequency Rate has declined during FY24: 2.01 
in FY24 compared with 2.92 in FY23.
We aim to foster a workplace where diversity is celebrated 
and our employees feel included. We understand that diverse 
thinking helps contribute to our innovative culture, among other 
things. Our activities in this area include targeted hiring policies, 
ongoing cultural sensitivity training, and specific  gender equality 
programs. FY24 saw a decrease in the number of women in 
our senior leadership team6 by two percentage points, bringing 
our gender ratio down from 35 per cent to 33 per cent. Our 
target for FY30 is to have a gender balance that is 40:40:20 for 
our senior leadership team, meaning 40 per cent who identify 
as women, 40 per cent who identify as men and 20 per cent 
who identify as men, women or other. Overall, we increased 
the total percentage of women at Nufarm this year by one 
percentage point, with women now making up 29 per cent 
of our employee population. We have identified  that supply 
chain, manufacturing and commercial remain three areas where 
our representation of women is lower and we will need more 
targeted initiatives to make a difference in our gender metrics in 
these areas.
Our employees remain engaged in our business, with our latest 
employee survey resulting in an engagement score of 797, 
which is top quartile compared with other organisations.8

We have made steady progress in responding to our 
environmental challenges. We continue to work towards 
aligning our climate-related disclosures with the Taskforce on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations.
We recorded a 42 per cent reduction in our greenhouse 
gas emissions from our FY20 baseline (FY23: 19 per cent 
reduction).9 This reduction was due to the extended shutdown 
of our synthesis plant at Pipe Road, Laverton, Australia.We continue to focus on our decarbonisation pathways and 
concluded a power purchase agreement at Pipe Road and 
Horsham, which will help us achieve our 30 per cent reduction 
target by FY30. We also continue to monitor the suitability of 
hydrogen energy supply for our Wyke site in the UK.
We understand the importance of a risk-based approach 
to environmental management. Our activities include training 
our workforce and conducting regular environmental audits, 
to ensure compliance with our environmental obligations. 
Currently 4 of our 11 crop protection manufacturing sites are 
ISO 14001 certified  and we are on track to certify six sites 
in the coming year to achieve our target of 10 sites certified 
to ISO 14001 by FY25. This initiative aims to embed strong 
governance and process around environmental management at 
our manufacturing sites.
We aim to use materials responsibly, reduce waste, and 
increase recycling rates. This year, our operational hazardous 
waste was 27 per cent below our FY20 baseline (FY23: 12 
per cent). This year-on-year change is mostly due to efforts 
made at Chicago Heights in North America to reduce their 
waste. We anticipate the activities planned at Chicago Heights 
will continue to reduce operational hazardous waste, helping 
us achieve our target of a 20 per cent reduction by FY25, 
measured from our FY20 baseline.10
Our efforts in air emissions management have progressed 
and we are focusing on reducing volatile organic compounds 
(VOCs) at our site in Linz, Austria. We have a target to reduce 
our VOC emissions by 25 per cent by FY25, measured from a 
FY20 baseline. Next year we will install a regenerative thermal 
oxidation (RTO) plant at Linz which will allow us to reduce 
VOC emissions to a much lower level, however, the impact of 
the solution will not be achieved in time for us to achieve our 
FY25 target.
We recognise the need to protect ecosystems and have 
incorporated biodiversity considerations into our operations 
and product development. Where applicable, we evaluate the 
potential impact of our products on biodiversity as a part of the 
registration process to minimise the risk of harm from their use.
Our planned sustainability activity for FY25
We made progress in FY24 against our sustainability plans, 
but as sustainability challenges grow we understand there 
will be increasing areas for improvement. In FY25, we will 
improve the processes needed to capture emissions across 
the group, including a spend-based approach to measure 
our scope 3 emissions. This will help us to comply with 
the Australian mandatory climate related financial  disclosure 
legislation coming into law on 1 January  2025, which Nufarm 
will report against for the first time in FY26.
6Our senior leadership team (SLT) comprises of the CEO's direct reports (CEO-1) and their direct reports (CEO-2).
7This is an employee satisfaction score out of 100.
8"Top Quartile" is in reference to the GLINT database of companies. We have partnered with GLINT to facilitate our employee engagement surveys. We 
benchmark Nufarm against GLINT's 900-strong customer base.
9Our greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) target is to reduce our scope 1 and 2 emissions from our crop protection manufacturing sites by 30 per cent by FY30, 
from a FY20 baseline.
10This year we produced approximately 23,000 tonnes of waste, of which 18,629 tonnes was hazardous waste. Due to significant  construction activities 
at several of our locations, over 4,000 tonnes (18 per cent) was non-operating hazardous waste, in the form of construction materials, soil and obsolete 
plant equipment. Our hazardous waste target was set with the intention of reducing our operational waste. As such we have separated non-operating 
(construction) waste from our hazardous waste performance measure.

Victorian, Australia sites and use the large-scale renewable 
energy certificates  (LGCs) to progressively offset our scope

Our Pipe Road site in Australia is our largest emitting 
site, comprising almost 50 per cent of our crop protection

Nufarm has seen extended shutdowns at our two synthesis plants as we conduct 
asset integrity and capacity enhancing work which has driven emissions reductions. 
These plants are the largest source of our scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions.
Adjusting for normal production levels in FY24 our GHG emissions would have been

TargetTonnesLinz has explored several technical solutions to reduce the VOC emissions since 
we set the reduction target. In FY23 we investigated a scrubber system which 
revealed the scrubber would not be suitable. The engineering team has determined 
a regenerative thermal oxidation (RTO) plant as the best viable solution to reduce the 
VOC emissions at the site. It has the potential to reduce emissions to much lower 
levels of concentration but will not be installed in time to meet our VOC target.Not on track

TargetKtonnesThis year we generated non-operating waste from construction activities at our crop 
protection manufacturing sites. When we established the target, these construction 
activities were not planned and the target was established to reduce operational 
hazardous waste, being the waste created from normal day to day operation of 
Nufarm’s crop protection, synthesis and formulation plants.
This year we saw our hazardous waste drop to 15 K tonnes, which is below our 
target. Our challenge is to maintain these lower levels going forward.On track
