KEY SEGMENT RESULTS SUMMARY (CONTINUED) 
Retail 
The Group’s retail portfolio continued to perform well in FY25, with occupancy holding firm at 95.5% and 
average rent reviews delivering growth of 3.9%.  The portfolio’s weighted average capitalisation rate (WACR) 
tightened by 12 basis points over the period to 6.46%, reflecting the quality of the assets and sustained tenant 
demand. 
An active sales campaign is currently underway for Oasis, a mixed-use asset located in Broadbeach, Queensland. 
The asset has attracted significant interest, and the Group remains focused on maintaining discipline in evaluating 
potential transaction outcomes. 
Commercial Valuations 
The investment property portfolio’s overall weighted average capitalisation rate expanded 27 basis points from 
6.50% in FY24 to 6.77% in FY25.  The Commercial portfolio (excluding equity accounted properties) was valued 
at $1.8 billion at 2025 year-end (FY24: $1.9 billion) across 15 assets (FY24: 16 assets). 
As a result of current market conditions and a shift in future expectations in the Office sector, Abacus Group has 
targeted assets that offer more stabilised income streams with longer dated value enhancing strategies.  This 
capital allocation strategy supports the Group’s drive to improve recurring earnings. 
Storage 
Abacus Group’s 19.8% equity interest in Abacus Storage King (ASK) continues to deliver value, with ASK 
reporting FY25 FFO of $85.0 million, up 4.7% on FY24, and a distribution of 6.20 cents per security, in line 
with guidance.  ASK’s scalable platform and strong national footprint supported average occupancy of 91.2% and 
rental growth of 4.1%, reflecting resilient demand and effective operational execution. 
ASK’s RevPAM rose 4.5% to $340psm, driven by both rate growth and a 40 basis point increase in occupancy. 
With robust operating conditions and a strong development pipeline, ASK remains well-positioned to deliver 
further growth through a combination of organic performance and strategic initiatives. 
SUSTAINABILITY PERFORMANCE 
Over the past 12 months, we have maintained a strong focus on delivering measurable outcomes through the 
execution of our sustainability strategy.  Our initiatives have continued to advance environmental and social 
priorities while supporting the organisation’s long-term business objectives. 
Key achievements include: 
A 61% reduction in emissions intensity compared to our FY19 baseline, reflecting our ongoing
commitment to net zero 2030 (scope 1 & 2).
90% of office buildings have transitioned to renewable electricity sources from 1 January 2025.
Achieved a Net Promoter Score (NPS) from our customers of +27, highlighting strong customer
engagement and satisfaction.
Achieved an employee engagement score of 83%, reflecting our commitment to fostering a
supportive, inclusive, and high-performing workplace culture.
A major focus for the Group moving forward is enhancing the customer experience which we believe will foster 
greater employee engagement and drive improved business performance.  We have recalibrated our 
environmental sustainability targets to align with our 2030 net zero commitment and are actively preparing to 
meet disclosure requirements under the Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards (ASRS) as a Group 3 
entity.

The LTI Plan is aimed at 
attracting, rewarding, and 
retaining high performing 
Executives and other nominated 
participants for delivering 
sustained long term growth and 
aligning them with securityholder 
interests. LTI granted are in the form of performance 
rights. 
Performance rights are subject to three 
independent performance conditions: 
-EBIT per security CAGR Abacus
Group
-Relative TSR Abacus Group (ABG)
-Relative TSR Abacus Storage King
(ASK)
50% of the performance rights are tested 
on the third anniversary of the grant date 
and 50% on the fourth anniversary of the 
grant date.  
The maximum LTI opportunity in FY25 was 
120% of FR for the MD, 100% of FR for 
the CFO and the CIO, and 75% of FR for 
the Group General Managers.  The granting of Corrective and
