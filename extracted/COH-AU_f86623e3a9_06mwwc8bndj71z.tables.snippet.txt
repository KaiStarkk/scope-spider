We conducted a qualitative scenario analysis to assess our climate risks and opportunities,
,Climate-related risks and opportunities
"across three time horizons: short-term (up to 2030), medium-term (up to 2040) and long-term",
(up to 2050). The analysis considered two different emission scenarios to assess potential,

impacts on Cochlear’s business and resilience:",
"•  A low emissions scenario, aligned with limiting global temperature rise to below 1.5°C,",
consistent with an orderly transition towards a decarbonized future and net-zero by 2050; and,
"•  A high emissions scenario, consistent with a conservative estimate of emissions reduction",
resulting in a temperature rise above 4°C by 2100.,
To identify potential physical and transition risks and opportunities across our operations and,
