environmental, Social and Governance ( eSG) Framework
NobleOak remains a committed advocate for building a sustainable and ethical community, continuing  
to invest in initiatives that support long‑term growth aligned with its ESG strategy and framework.
The Board and management at NobleOak acknowledge the critical importance of robust environmental,  
social, and governance practices and are committed to upholding these principles across the organisation.
Environmental
NobleOak is committed to managing its environmental footprint across daily operations, guided by a set of 
established metrics that enable ongoing measurement and monitoring of environmental impacts. The company’s 
headquarters at 44 Market Street, Sydney continues to boast a 5‑star NABERS Energy Rating and a 4.5‑star 
NABERS Water Rating, reflecting its dedication to sustainable infrastructure.
NobleOak remains committed to evolving its environmental management practices and reducing carbon 
emissions. In FY25, the company launched its “Going to Green” initiative, encouraging policyholders to opt for 
digital correspondence. This shift not only supports environmental sustainability but also contributes to waste 
reduction. Through this and other initiatives, NobleOak continues to foster a more sustainable and socially 
responsible operating environment.
NobleOak continued to investment in technology throughout FY25, enhancing its client portal with additional 
functionality that supports a shift towards digital customer interactions. This transition has reduced reliance on 
physical documents and aligns with the company’s broader environmental objectives. In line with its commitment 
to sustainability, Noble Oak has engaged a 3rd party to certify its operational emissions as we work towards 
reducing our carbon footprint and meeting our ESG goals. As part of this initiative, NobleOak purchased a 
combination of Australian Carbon Credit Units and International Verified Emission Reductions (VERs) units.
Social
In FY25, NobleOak deepened its commitment to social responsibility by expanding initiatives that foster inclusion, 
wellbeing, and community engagement. Building on the success of its employee led community giving programme, 
NobleOak introduced new channels for volunteering and donation matching, resulting in increased participation 
across the workforce.
The company continued to champion diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging, while also embedding cultural 
values into shared KPIs to reinforce accountability. NobleOak maintained its focus on leadership diversity, with 
women representing 55% of all people leaders and 44% of the Senior Leadership Team.
Progress continued on closing the gender pay gap, with strengthened remuneration policies and benchmarking 
practices ensuring alignment with market standards and transparency in pay equity.
Governance
NobleOak remains committed to strong corporate governance and risk management practices, fostering investor 
confidence through transparency and timely, appropriate disclosure. The company’s governance practices are 
aligned with the ASX Corporate Governance Principles and Recommendations and are embedded in NobleOak’s 
purpose and values. The Corporate Governance Statement, approved by the Board, is publicly available on 
NobleOak’s website: https://www.nobleoak.com.au/corporategovernance/.
