railed grain tonnes. Rail freight is much less emissions,
intensive than road and Qube actively works with,
its customers to encourage the transition of freight,
"volumes from road to rail, where feasible, to support the",
decarbonisation of the economy.,
"In FY25, we commenced a review of our existing",
"decarbonisation programs and targets, to inform the",
development of a new Qube group-level transition,
plan. This plan will include a structured decarbonisation,
roadmap addressing near to medium-term transition,

climate-related risks and opportunities and will address,
Qube’s role in contributing to the value chain and,

"Finally, the Opportunity chapter of this report details",
some of the important work our teams have delivered,
"this year in cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence and the",
deployment of technology solutions to enhance the,
"safety, efficiency and productivity of our operations.",
From wearable tech to protect the health and safety,
"of our people, including those working in remote",

We are also focused on creating opportunity for the,

•  Operational GHG emissions (Scope 2).,,

=== Table 5 (page 44) ===
"In FY25, Qube’s total Australian absolute calculated GHG emissions were approximately 437 thousand tonnes of carbon"
dioxide equivalent (KtCO2-e). This included 415 KtCO2-e Scope 1 and 23 KtCO2-e Scope 2 (location-based).
This represents a 5% increase in operational GHG emissions compared with FY241 and this is tied to business growth
and operational activity.
Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity performance (tCO2-e/$M revenue) resulted in an 17% decrease year on year and a
50% reduction against our FY18 base year2.
Our FY25 revenue figure includes Qube’s grain trading activities which commenced in December 2023 and made a
material contribution (~20%) during FY25. Accounting for annual revenue excluding grain trading activities in FY25
results in a 1% emissions intensity reduction compared to FY24.
