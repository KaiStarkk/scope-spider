Reasonable assurance opinion
"In our opinion, in all material respects, the Group has prepared the Reasonable Assurance Subject"
"Matter Information in Table 3, in accordance with the Criteria for year ended 30 June 2025."
Use and distribution of our report
We were engaged by the board of directors of the Group to prepare this independent assurance report
having regard to the Criteria specified by management and set out in this report. This report was
prepared solely for the Group for providing a combination of limited and reasonable assurance in
respect of the Subject Mater Information contained within its 2025 Reporting Suite for the year ended
30 June 2025.
"We accept no duty, responsibility or liability to anyone other than the Group in connection with this"
report or to the Group for the consequences of using or relying on it for a purpose other than that
referred to above. We make no representation concerning the appropriateness of this report for
anyone other than the Group and if anyone other than the Group chooses to use or rely on it they do
so at their own risk.
"This disclaimer applies to the maximum extent permitted by law and, without limitation, to liability"
arising in negligence or under statute and even if we consent to anyone other than the Group
receiving or using this report.
Other Matter
The comparative information for Total Scope 3 GHG emissions FY19-FY24 (the comparative periods)
"has not been adjusted for a material misstatement in the comparative periods, the details of which are"
"described in the Sustainability Basis of Preparation on page 10 (Scope 3, Category 1, Purchased"
Goods and Services ‘Calculation methodology’ and ‘Additional notes’). Our conclusion regarding the
current period's presentation does not extend to this comparative information. Our conclusion is not
modified in respect of this matter.
