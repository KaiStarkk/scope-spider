In contrast, The Star Sydney and The Star Gold 
Coast both recorded modest reductions in energy consumption, reflecting the success of localised efficiency efforts and operational maturity.
The resource performance over time graphs 
depict a consistent downward trend in consumption and waste generation, reflecting the significant measurable progress achieved through our targeted sustainability initiatives and operational improvements. 
While energy has been a key focus in FY25, in 
FY26, enhanced water management and efficiency initiatives will be a core priority, with outcomes facilitated largely through the Property Energy and Water Working Groups of which we have at each of our sites. 
Additional key focus areas for FY26 include:
 •Str
engthening accountability and governance, 
with properties required to report the 
environmental and resource performance of their sites to the respective Property CEOs and Property Boards, ensuring closer management and oversight of environmental outcomes at the asset level
 •Enhancing education and engagemen
t 
with
 
team members to foster further 
behavioural
 
improvements and operational 
awareness, supporting a culture of environmental sustainability
 •Exploring oppor
tunities to improve submetering 
infrastructure, including the completion of metering audits, to enhance data visibility, enable more accurate tracking, and reinforce accountability for resource use
 •The de
velopment of new energy, carbon, 
water and waste targets to drive performance outcomes in resource reductions.3.1.2 Energy
Resource use reduction and improving environmental outcomes remain as key priorities in the operation of our portfolio. 
The Star’s total energy consumption for FY25 
was 669,586 GJ, marking an 11.7% increase in consumption from FY24, and an energy intensity by
 
area increase of 6.7%.

3.1.3 Carbon Emissions
The Group’s Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions for 
FY25 were 9,106 tonnes (tCO2-e) and 94,735 tonnes 
(tCO2-e), respectively. Total Scope 1 and 
Scope
 
2 carbon emissions were 103,841 tonnes 
(tCO2-e) for the year, which was an 11.5% increase 
from FY24. 
As noted above, the increase was anticipated and 
primarily driven by the addition of The Star Brisbane at Queen’s Wharf to our portfolio. While the Treasury Casino ceased operations in the financial year, the Treasury Hotel continued to operate, contributing marginally to the overall footprint.
The Star continues to monitor consumption 
and performance and strives for year-on-year decarbonisation reductions.

In FY19, The Star established an ambitious Net Zero 
by 2030 target for Scope 1 and 2 emissions across wholly owned and operated assets, considered best practice at the time. Since then, in line with the approved Remediation Plan, our focus has been on delivering on our remediation commitments, regaining our suitability to hold our casino licences and restoring trust with all of our stakeholders including our shareholders, team members, customers, and the broader community. 
To ensure our emissions reduction efforts remain 
aligned with our current operating context and long-term ambitions, The Star plans to establish a new baseline and revised timeline during FY26. This will be complemented by a re-evaluation and remapping of our net zero pathway to ensure its long-term feasibility for the business. This reassessment presents an opportunity to align our net zero pathway with the latest industry developments and standards, and updating it to reflect operational changes in our portfolio and evolving stakeholder expectations.

3.1.4 Water consumption 
The Star remains dedicated to monitoring water 
consumption and performance across our portfolio to enhance water conservation efforts. 
The Star’s water consumption was 720,727 kL 
which was an increase of 15% in FY25 compared to FY24 and by 10% in intensity (kL/sqm). Similar to the energy and carbon emissions, the increase in water consumption can be somewhat attributed to the opening of The Star Brisbane at Queen’s Wharf to our portfolio during the year. In FY26, greater emphasis will be placed on improving water efficiency and conservation, with a focus on optimising water use across all operational areas.

In FY25, we achieved 41% waste diversion at our 
properties, representing a 4.7% decrease from FY24 recycling rates. 
The Star is committed to reducing total waste 
volumes, improving waste diversion from landfill, reducing food waste at the point of generation and organics recycling and increasing the number of recycling streams across its properties. In FY25:
We diverted various waste streams from landfill Including styrofoam, e-waste, metal, textiles, green waste, paint, organics, soft plastics, oil, and
 
cardboard. 
Food donation partnerships continued with Oz Harvest with 3,719 kgs (7,438 meals) donated in FY25, and 71,518 kgs donated to date.
543kg of soap was diverted from landfill and reprocessed into 5,430 bars of brand-new soap and distributed to vulnerable communities through Soap Aid.
The Star has been a signatory to APCO since FY22. In FY25, we submitted our third Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation (APCO) Action Plan and Annual Report. 
98% of our food takeaway packaging is compostable. We continue to investigate new compostable packaging products as they become available in the market.
Through our Dream Green sustainable bedding partnership, in FY25, The
 
Star Group has avoided sending 
25,076 plastic bottles to landfill, and 271,399 bottles to date.
583,020 kg of glass bottles have been crushed, recycled and processed back into new bottles with our waste partner Bottle Cycler in FY25.

The Star recognises that climate 
change presents a risk to our business, including through disruptions to supply, impacts of extreme weather events, and policy changes. 
3.2.1 Mandatory climate-related 
financial disclosures
The Group recognises that managing climate-
related risks and opportunities is critical to long-term value creation and business resilience. The Star’s early adoption of the TCFD framework in 2020 has positioned the company well to meet the forthcoming Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards (ASRS) mandatory climate-related disclosure requirements, which will apply to Group
 
1 entities, such as The Star, from FY26 
(AASB S2).
To assist with readiness and compliance, a gap 
assessment and roadmap was completed by an independent party in FY24. The findings of this assessment allowed us to pursue an updated climate risk and opportunity assessment and climate scenario analysis during FY25. 
Our FY25 efforts represent a step toward full 
alignment with AASB S2, and we remain committed to enhancing our disclosures and strengthening our approach to addressing climate-related risks.3. ENVIRONMENT (CONT.)

3.3  SUSTAINABLE PRECINCTS
The Star is committed to considering 
sustainability in the design, development, operations and management of our assets, with a focus on environmental responsibility and operational efficiency. 
In FY25, The Star implemented several initiatives 
via its building management systems (BMS) and environmental working groups at the properties which delivered measurable outcomes:
 •Elec
tricity savings: 1,248,711 kWH
 •Carbon emissions sa
vings: 1,096 tCO2e
 •W
ater savings: 519kL.CASE STUDY: QUEEN’S WHARF BRISBANE
Queen’s Wharf has achieved a 6-Star Green Star Communities rating, with climate considerations embedded across the project lifecycle. Design of Queen’s Wharf sought to avoid usage of highly emissions intensive materials, reducing use of Portland cement by at least 31%, and sourcing steel and timber to meet responsible building material requirements. Additionally, over 95% of construction and demolition waste was recovered for recycling, exceeding the benchmarks required by the 6 Star Green Star rating. Climate resiliency was also considered in development, with all stormwater drains developed to withstand 1-in-100-year rain events and to allow water to leave the site without impacting the building. Climate considerations are also embedded in building operation, with 100% of base building electricity from renewable sources. 
In acknowledgement of the importance 
of green spaces, Queen’s Wharf also includes over 300 trees and approximately 20,000 plants. This includes The Landing, a 6,500 square metres green space along the river beyond the Riverside Expressway. 
Green spaces not only provide climate 
benefits, including carbon sequestration and areas which mitigate urban heat, but also other environmental and social co-benefits, including spaces which support community wellbeing and provide habitats which promote
 
biodiversity.
