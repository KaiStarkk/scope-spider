During this process, engagement was sought from 
the Company’s key stakeholders, and the materiality 
assessment was concluded during the reporting period. 
The materiality assessment identified five material topics 
against which the Company will begin to measure and 
disclose against in future reporting periods, being:
 ■Regulatory risk;
 ■Energy use;
 ■Electric vehicle (EV) diversification;
 ■Modern slavery and human rights; and
 ■Supply chain risk.
Recognising the upcoming disclosure requirements of 
climate-related financial information under the Australian 
Sustainability Reporting Standards (ASRS), the engagement 
was extended to a gap analysis to understand our 
readiness to report against ASRS S1 and S2 (Gap Analysis) 
with the objective to identify key disclosure and process 
gaps as well as opportunities. This will assist the Company 
to adopt an ASRS-aligned reporting framework and plan a 
strategic response to ESG risks and opportunities.
NEXT STEPS
 ■MotorCycle Holdings’ executive 
team are working to formalise 
the prioritisation of material 
topics identified in the Materiality 
Assessment, and consider 
appropriate metrics against which 
these will be measured. This will 
form the basis of our ESG Strategy 
and framework.
 ■A road map for ASRS reporting 
was developed during the Gap 
Analysis which Management will 
begin the path towards. Initially 
this will be by considering how 
the activities in the roadmap 
will be resourced and what 
governance structures will be 
required to support the company’s 
progression to being ready to 
report under the new ASRS. 
 ■From there, internal ESG reporting 
processes for future greenhouse 
gas emissions (GHG) emissions 
reporting will be developed.
