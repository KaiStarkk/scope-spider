HEALTHIER PLANET
RECOGNISING
our responsibility  
for the planet  
and future 
generations
With nourishment at the core of 
our purpose, Noumi recognises 
its responsibility to protect 
the natural environments that 
sustain our business. 
Wherever possible, we source 
our ingredients from responsible 
farmers and manufacture our 
food and beverage products 
to minimise the impact on the 
environment.CLIMATE  
CHANGE 
 
Noumi has conducted a 
Greenhouse Gas (GHG) inventory 
and has assessed strategies for 
mitigating GHG emissions. Based 
on the outcomes of this work, 
Noumi has revised its emissions 
reduction target for Scope 1 
and 2 to 40-50% by 2030. This 
outcome is contingent on the 
rate of electrical grid greening 
and continued reduction in the 
capital cost of GHG mitigating 
technologies.WASTE AND SUSTAINABLE 
WATER USE 
 
Waste reduction is a key pillar of 
Noumi’s Operational Excellence 
(OPX) program. Since its start 
in 2023, the program has made 
significant gains in operational 
performance. In FY25, waste 
diversion from landfill was 86%, 
and we continue to partner with 
our service providers to identify 
improved recycling methods to 
further cut waste to landfill. As 
the program evolves, improved 
processes will lead to less product 
and water waste, and reduced 
water consumption.  SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE AND ANIMAL WELFARE 
 PACKAGING 
 
Noumi supports APCO’s consumer 
packaging targets. All paper-
based shipping materials will 
incorporate the maximum 
possible recycled content by 2026. 
Where feasible and commercially 
viable, plastic-based packaging 
will contain 50% recycled content 
and be recyclable by 2030.
Noumi has removed carbon black 
from all plastic packaging well 
ahead of its 2030 target. We have 
also replaced plastic straws with 
paper alternatives for all products 
sold in Australia. 
Currently, the laminated structure 
of liquid paper board makes 
this product difficult to recycle 
or incorporate recycled content. 
Noumi is collaborating with 
suppliers on how to incorporate 
recycled content into this 
packaging while maintaining  
pack integrity.
Given the constraints with liquid 
paper board, Noumi is targeting 
29% recycled content for 
packaging for shelf-stable plant 
and dairy-based products.Healthy cows are essential to 
producing high-quality milk. Our 
dairy farms are the cornerstone 
of our dairy operation, and animal 
welfare is an ethical responsibility 
we take seriously. Our dairy farms 
are built on a commitment to 
the highest standards of care for 
every herd we support.
Noumi’s Food Safety Program 
(FSP) provides us with regular, 
ongoing opportunities to partner 
with our farmers on animal 
welfare. Our farmers use a range 
of best practice methodologies to 
manage heat stress, lameness and 
disbudding pain relief, ensuring 
high standards of animal welfare.In addition to the FSP, in FY25 
Noumi surveyed every Dairy 
farming partner to collect 
baseline data on various aspects 
of their dairy operations. The 
survey sought to understand 
GHG emissions, climate change 
adaptations and biosecurity 
issues. The information collected 
will be used to track our progress 
in meeting sustainability targets 
over the coming seasons.
Biosecurity is of vital importance 
to the Noumi business for the 
wellbeing of the animals as well 
as the consumers who purchase 
our products. Our farmers already 
have biosecurity management 
plans in place in the unlikely  
event of a disease outbreak on 
their property.
