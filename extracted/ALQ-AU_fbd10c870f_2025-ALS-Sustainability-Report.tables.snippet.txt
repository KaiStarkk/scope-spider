"12.  Life Sciences – Lima Food received a USD$15,000 fine for not complying with environmental monitoring plans during Dec 2017 – Nov 2018. The non-compliance",
,resulted from an error which occurred when the relocation to a new facility was delayed. The facility has complied with its monitoring requirements since 2019
,which are audited regularly by the HSE team and part of the Annual HSE Plan.
"13.  The FY25 total CO₂e figure is higher than the subcomponents due to Defra CO₂e emission factors only being published for hydrotreated fuel oil. (CO₂, CH4 and N20",
