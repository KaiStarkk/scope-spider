ENVIRONMENT 
AND CLIMATE 
Our Environmental Management Framework ensures environmental obligations and risks across our operations 
are identified, managed and monitored, and adverse environmental impacts are minimised. It provides for, where 
feasible, improving the energy efficiency of operations, using alternative fuels, diverting waste from landfill to 
beneficial uses, increasing water use efficiency, the responsible sourcing of products, and progressive rehabilitation 
and responsible use of buffer land.  
The Group recognises the potential financial, physical, transitional, and reputational risks and opportunities 
posed to the business and the broader sector due to climate change. Climate risk is incorporated into our risk 
management frameworks. Managing and responding to climate related risk and opportunities supports our 
strategy for long term success and delivers value creation to our investors.  
Maas supports the national decarbonisation agenda, along with transparency and accountability in its 
environmental practices. The Group will make climate related financial disclosures in our FY26 report and is 
currently assessing its targets and ambitions for future years which align with viable decarbonisation pathways.  
In FY25, the Group’s greenhouse gas emissions data is reported below. Maas remains committed to minimising environmental and climate related impacts,  
fostering responsible practices across its operations.
