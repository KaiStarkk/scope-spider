Emissions
Targets
• Carbon neutral by 2035
• Carbon net zero by 2050  
Relevant United Nations Sustainable  
Development Goals
Select Harvests operates in an industry known for high 
emission levels, primarily from electricity consumption, 
fumigation, fuel use and field emissions related to fertilisers, soil 
amendments and field burning. In January 2022, we committed 
to achieving carbon neutrality by 2035 and net zero emissions 
by 2050, using 2020–21 as our baseline year. In 2024, we 
continue to report our scope 1 and 2 emissions to the Clean 
Energy Regulator, in compliance with the National Greenhouse 
and Energy Reporting Scheme (NGER). We have obtained 
limited assurance for the second time to ensure the accuracy 
and integrity of our emissions data. Our team is working on 
establishing an emissions reduction pathway to achieve our net 
zero target.
Monitoring our impact
To calculate our emissions, we adhere to international carbon 
footprint guidelines and the Australian National Inventory 
Report methods. Our emissions are categorised as scope 1, 2 
or 3 sources in accordance with the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) 
Protocol. We report emissions as carbon dioxide equivalents 
(CO₂e) and include all sites owned and operated by Select 
Harvests.
Our carbon footprint includes scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, 
from the transport of inputs to our orchards through to the 
delivery of finished products to domestic customers and 
distribution centres.
Our performance
In the 2023–24 period, we recorded a 6% increase in 
emissions, largely due to the increased electricity demands 
associated with increased crop volume. However, while raw 
emissions have risen, we have achieved greater efficiency, 
with fewer tonnes of emissions per tonne of processed 
almonds than in the previous reporting period. Since the 
baseline year of 2020–21, emissions have decreased by 21% 
from 178,441 tonnes CO₂e to 141,218 tonnes CO₂e.
Scope 1 emissions remained stable in 2023–24. 
Scope 2 emissions have increased by 9% in 2023-24.  The 
increase in our scope 2 emissions can be attributed to 
increased almond volume in the reporting period, from 23,130 
tonnes in 2022–23 to 40,047 tonnes in 2023–24. However, our 
improved production efficiency has driven a 25% improvement 
in emissions intensity in our processing division.  This 
improvement has been driven by upgrading equipment to 
more energy efficient options within our facility.  
Once again, a similar trend can be seen within our scope 3 
emissions, seeing an increase of 7%. This increase is once 
again due to increased crop size driving an increase in fuel 
required to transport crops to our processing facility and to 
our customers.  
Orchard emissions intensity per tonne of kernel decreased 
due to increased efficiencies at both our orchards and 
processing facilities. Total greenhouse gas emissions by scope (processing 
facilities and orchards)

Electricity production and consumption (GWh) 
Our emission reduction strategy focuses on leveraging 
renewable energy and maximising resource efficiency. At its 
core is the biomass renewable power station, which supplies 
clean energy to our processing facility in Wemen and supports 
irrigation for neighbouring orchards.
During 2023–24, the station generated 20,991,543 kWh of 
electricity, enough to power approximately 3,274 homes in 
Victoria. Of this, 44% was used to meet our energy needs, 
while surplus electricity was sold to other users, contributing 
to external energy demands.
During 2023-24, we have not sold any Large-scale Generation 
Certificates (LGCs). Instead, we have chosen to retain them as 
part of our strategic focus on enhancing our emission 
reduction efforts and supporting our long-term net zero 
ambitions. While we continue to evaluate future opportunities 
for selling LGCs, our current approach prioritizes their 
potential to strengthen our sustainability initiatives over time.
