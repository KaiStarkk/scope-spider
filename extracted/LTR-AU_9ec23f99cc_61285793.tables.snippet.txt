,"FY25	marked	Liontown’s	first	year	of	operation	at	Kathleen	Valley,	an",,,
,important milestone in our journey from project development to producer.,,,
,"This new phase brought greater responsibility, together with the opportunity",,,

,"People are central to everything we do. In FY25, we prioritised safety as",,,

,culture across both our workforce and contracting partners. While our TRIFR,,,
