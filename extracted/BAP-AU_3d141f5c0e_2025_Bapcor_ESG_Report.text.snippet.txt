Our Environment
In FY25, we continued to develop our 
decarbonisation strategy to reduce emissions  
as well as our approach to managing the risks, 
opportunities, and compliance requirements 
linked to climate change. We also accelerated 
efforts to reduce waste and have introduced 
more sustainable packaging across our  
Own Brand portfolio. These initiatives, supported  
by collaboration and innovation, are central  
to ensuring a  sustainable future for our  
business and the communities we serve.

Emissions reduction targets 
Why emissions reduction targets  
matter to Bapcor
Bapcor recognises the growing importance of 
understanding and managing greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions in response to the impacts of climate 
change. As a business with extensive operational, 
transport and supply chain footprints across Australia, 
New Zealand, and Thailand, managing and reducing 
emissions is important to controlling operating costs, 
meeting stakeholder expectations, and aligning  
with emerging regulatory requirements.
In FY25, our focus remained on strengthening the 
systems and processes that underpin our emissions 
measurement. High‑quality data is critical to identifying 
reduction opportunities, supporting investment 
decisions, and tracking progress against our 
long‑term commitments. While previous years had 
seen increases in Scope 1 and 2 emissions, these 
improvements have contributed to a small decrease 
in both compared to FY24. This work also positions 
Bapcor to meet future climate‑related disclosure 
requirements under the Australian Sustainability 
Reporting Standards (ASRS), which will require certain 
companies to report Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. 
Scope 1 and 2
Bapcor has committed to reducing Scope 1 and 2 
emissions by 40% by FY30 and 50% by FY33, from  
an FY23 baseline. In FY25, we focused on improving 
the accuracy and coverage of our emissions data  
to support long‑term target delivery.
Compared to FY24, Scope 1 emissions decreased  
by 7% and Scope 2 emissions (market‑based) 
decreased by 4%. For detailed Scope 1 and 2 emissions data for FY25 and previous years,  
refer to Table 2. These changes reflect both 
operational improvements and enhanced data 
quality. Scope 1 emissions are predominantly 
generated from fuel used in our fleet operations,  
as well as stationary fuel and refrigerant use  
across our sites. Scope 2 emissions arise from the 
consumption of purchased electricity consumed 
across our entire network including our DCs, 
warehouses, stores, and office operations.
To strengthen our reporting, we continued  
expanding our centralised energy data platform, 
enabling improved visibility and traceability of  
Scope 2 emissions across Australia and New Zealand. 
We also maintain high data quality and accuracy  
in our Scope 1 emissions reporting, supported by 
detailed tracking of fleet fuel use through fuel cards. 
This robust data collection underpins our emissions 
calculations and strengthens the reliability of 
our reporting.
Fleet remains one of the most material contributors  
to Bapcor’s operational emissions. During FY25,  
we completed a detailed review of our fleet profile, 
including fuel types and vehicle categories, and 
explored scenarios for achieving a lower emissions 
fleet. In parallel, emissions associated with warehouse 
operations and freight movements were reviewed  
as part of ongoing site consolidation planning.  
These assessments are helping to inform how 
operational changes can contribute to reducing 
emissions over the medium term.
All Scope 1 and 2 emissions are calculated in line  
with best practice methodologies, applying the 
National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER) 
Scheme1 requirements and maintaining alignment 
with the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol. 
1.  https://cer.gov.au/schemes/national ‑greenhouse ‑and‑energy ‑reporting ‑scheme.
2.  Location‑based method:  Location‑based emissions estimation methods are based on onsite consumption multiplied by industry 
averages and typically do not reflect a company’s decision to purchase renewable energy or products calculates GHG emissions 
based on the average emissions intensity of grids on which energy consumption occurs. 
 Market‑based method:  The market‑based method of estimating Scope 2 emissions subtracts eligible renewable energy purchases 
from the total quantity of purchased or acquired electricity that is not considered renewable before applying an emissions factor  
to the residual electricity.Table 2: GHG emissions (tCO2e)

Table 3: Scope 3 upstream categoriesScope 3
In FY25, Bapcor continued building on foundational 
work to identify and address the most material 
sources of Scope 3 emissions across its value chain.  
A structured screening was conducted, allowing 
Bapcor to determine priority areas for data collection 
and process development.
Three upstream categories were identified as most 
relevant for Bapcor: purchased goods and services, 
upstream transport, and waste. For purchased goods 
and services, the focus was on understanding the 
emissions footprint of Bapcor’s spend, supported  
by the development of a new data management 
platform. In upstream transport, Bapcor engaged 
directly with major freight providers to begin collecting 
primary emissions data and improve transparency. 
Waste was added as a relevant Scope 3 emissions 
category to reflect Bapcor’s ability to influence both 
the volume generated and the methods used for 
disposal, recognising it as an area the organisation 
can actively manage and reduce. Internal work also progressed to formalise data 
ownership, clarify category boundaries, and establish 
repeatable processes for future Scope 3 data 
collection and reporting.
Progress through collaboration
In FY25, a key development was the collaboration 
between our ESG Team and the Fleet and Property 
Teams. Leveraging improved Scope 1 and 2 datasets, 
this joint approach has helped pinpoint areas where 
emissions reductions can be achieved and deliver 
‘quick win’ opportunities that support progress towards 
our long‑term targets. Work also commenced on 
expanding emissions tracking, with early steps taken 
towards covering the full Scope 3 upstream footprint 
in line with the GHG Protocol. These efforts included 
refining data accuracy and trialling enhanced partner 
dashboards to improve visibility and engagement  
with logistics and supply chain partners. This work  
is essential in preparing for upcoming mandatory 
climate‑related disclosure requirements under ASRS, 
which will require companies to report their material 
Scope 3 emissions from the second year of reporting.
 Looking ahead
In FY26, our focus will shift to the implementation  
of emissions reduction strategies, driving meaningful 
progress across initiatives. Expanding our Scope 3 
coverage will remain a priority, enabling a more 
complete understanding of value chain emissions 
and supporting alignment with ASRS requirements. 
Enhanced partner dashboards will be rolled out  to 
provide real‑time data and strengthen collaboration with key partners. As part of our broader energy 
reduction strategy, permit applications are now 
pending for a solar system at our largest DC in Victoria. 
Throughout this work, emissions considerations will 
continue to be embedded into  governance and planning 
frameworks, ensuring  operational accountability and 
informed decision‑making as we move toward our  
long‑term  emissions reduction goals.Category Relevance Actions underway
