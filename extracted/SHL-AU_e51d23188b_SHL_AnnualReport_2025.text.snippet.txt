SONIC HEALTHCARE  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2025OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
Diagnostic imaging (including radiology) is the medical specialty of using medical imaging technologies to diagnose and 
treat diseases. The array of imaging technologies includes magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), 
positron emission tomography (PET), nuclear medicine studies, ultrasound, mammography, bone densitometry and general 
X-ray. Diagnostic imaging also includes interventional radiology, the performance of medical procedures under the guidance of 
imaging technologies.
In addition to clinical laboratories and diagnostic imaging, Sonic conducts a number of smaller complementary businesses 
(disclosed in the Other category in the Segment information note, along with corporate office costs). The most significant 
of these are the Independent Practitioner Network (IPN) medical centre business, the Sonic HealthPlus occupational health 
business, and Australia’s largest skin health business, together involve more than 200 primary care clinics across Australia, 
providing facilities and administrative services to around 2,000 general practitioners. Approximately 70% of all Australians live 
within 10 kilometres of a Sonic clinic.

SONIC HEALTHCARE  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2025OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
 ¡Sonic’s businesses rely on information technology systems. A disruption to a core IT platform, including as a result of a 
cybersecurity breach, could have significant operational, financial and/or reputational impacts, particularly if confidential 
patient data were to be obtained by unauthorised persons. Sonic has implemented strategies to mitigate this risk. The 
Company has a comprehensive Information Security Management System (ISMS) in place, supported by staff training and 
awareness programs. Internal systems are monitored and regularly tested (at a minimum, as changes are made to the core 
software or infrastructure). The information security objectives of confidentiality, integrity, access and privacy are achieved 
by the implementation of a multi-layered approach and application of key controls (defence-in-depth). Sonic’s ISMS sets out 
the controls in the following domains: Governance and Administrative, Information Security, Personnel Security, Physical 
Security, Operational Security, Technical Security and Cyber Security. External facing systems are monitored and regularly 
tested (including third party penetration testing). As part of Sonic’s compliance work for specific country requirements (such 
as KRITIS in Germany, ISO27001 in the UK, ISM and ISO27001 in Australia, SOC2, ISO27001 and HITRUST in USA) these 
protections are continually reviewed and improved. An external provider is engaged to conduct Global NIST Maturity Audits 
for all of Sonic’s countries of operation, assessing ongoing improvements against a baseline.
 ¡Whilst individual events are unlikely to have any significant impact, inaccurate diagnostic results due to actual or alleged 
mistakes or errors could result in financial loss and/or reputational damage, particularly if the issue is systemic. Sonic maintains 
insurance cover to mitigate its financial exposure and has processes in place to manage reputational risks.
 ¡Sonic uses prudent levels of debt to reduce its cost of capital and to increase earnings per share. It is therefore subject to the 
risk of rising interest rates (either on floating rate debt or when existing facilities expire), the future availability of funding, and 
potential breach of a term or condition of its debt facilities. Sonic has a sophisticated Treasury Policy in place to manage these 
risks, developed and overseen by Sonic’s Treasury Management Committee, which includes a renowned expert external 
consultant.
 ¡With operations in seven jurisdictions, Sonic is potentially exposed to changes in taxation legislation or interpretation which 
could increase its effective tax rate.
The Sonic Board has continued its careful consideration of environmental and social sustainability risks, with a particular focus 
on climate-related risks and human rights. 
In FY2025, the Company completed a quantitative assessment of the potential financial impacts of climate-related risks and 
opportunities. This assessment built on qualitative analysis conducted in FY2023 by quantifying potential financial impacts of 
prioritised climate-related risks and opportunities deemed to be most potentially material for Sonic. For the quantitative analysis, 
three time horizons were considered – short-term (to 2030), medium-term (to 2040), and long-term (to 2050). For each horizon, 
the analysis evaluated physical and transition-related outcomes under two distinct emissions scenarios: a low-emissions 
scenario (1.5°C aligned, assuming strong global climate action) and a high-emissions scenario (3°C+, business-as-usual). This 
approach ensured the assessment captured near-term influences as well as longer-range uncertainties under a changing 
climate. In total, five climate-related risks and one opportunity were examined across these scenarios and timeframes.
The exercise found that most assessed climate risks and opportunities are unlikely to cause material financial impacts for Sonic 
in the near to long-term, with the exception of potential carbon pricing under a scenario of aggressive climate action. The carbon 
pricing risk refers to a scenario that considers an additional operating expense that may be borne by companies for each tonne 
of carbon that they produce in future. The per tonne cost of carbon evaluated by Sonic is based on the Network for Greening 
the Financial System’s (NGFS) ‘shadow emissions price’ which acts as a proxy for policy stringency (such as governments 
introducing a carbon tax) and technological change (such as costs associated with development of low carbon products 
passed through from the supply chain), which rises with more ambitious climate action. 
Under the low-emissions scenario (NGFS ‘Net Zero’, strong climate action), where aggressive policies to limit warming are 
assumed, modelling showed Sonic could face potentially material financial exposure across all time horizons if our emissions 
were to continue to grow without any mitigation efforts. In practice, Sonic is actively reducing emissions, and has committed 
to net zero emissions by 2050. By contrast, in a high-emissions scenario (NGFS ‘Current Policies’, with slower or minimal policy 
action), the NGFS shadow carbon price remains significantly lower, resulting in a smaller financial impact. As such, the overall 
materiality impact of this risk is highly scenario dependent.
Whilst a carbon pricing cost carries potential material risk for Sonic, the magnitude of its impact is uncertain. The assessment 
conducted requires assumptions about future carbon price levels, timing, and geographic scope, which are uncertain given 
evolving climate policies. 
Additionally, Sonic’s own future emissions profile (influenced by growth and decarbonisation efforts) will affect costs – if Sonic 
reduces its carbon footprint, the financial impact from any given carbon price would lessen, and vice versa.

SONIC HEALTHCARE  |  ANNUAL REPORT 2025OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
Ultimately, the quantitative risk assessment exercise identified a potential carbon pricing cost as material under certain scenarios 
and time horizons, but the exact scale of impact has a confidence range. Sonic will continue to refine this analysis as policies 
and our ability to project future emissions evolve.
Despite the uncertainties associated with this risk, importantly, it highlights carbon cost exposure as a key climate-related risk 
for Sonic to strategically manage. As with other climate risks evaluated in the quantitative analysis and found to be non-material, 
Sonic recognises that monitoring and management of these risks provides vital insights for enhancing climate and operational 
resilience for the future, even in the event they don’t materially impact short-, medium-, or long-term finances at a corporate level. 
Details of Sonic’s FY2025 quantitative assessment of climate-related risks and opportunities will be available in the Company’s 
2025 Sustainability Report, ahead of disclosure in Sonic’s FY2026 Annual Report in accordance with the Australian 
Sustainability Reporting Standards (ASRS).
Although Sonic’s operations are located in developed nations with well-established laws governing labour standards and 
human rights, the Company remains vigilant in its review of its own operations and global supply chain to identify and reduce 
the risk of modern slavery practices. Please refer to our 2025 Modern Slavery Statement (available in November 2025) for 
more details.
The above list should not be taken to be a comprehensive list of risks associated with Sonic. In particular, it excludes risks 
relating to the general economic environment and other generic risk areas that affect most companies.
Sonic’s geographic, business line and branding diversification, plus our federation structure, broad menu of tests offered and 
low customer concentrations mean that few, if any, of the usual operating risks faced by a healthcare business would have a 
material impact on Sonic as a whole.
MATTERS SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF THE FINANCIAL YEAR
Since the end of the financial year, the Directors are not aware of any matter or circumstance not otherwise dealt with in these 
financial statements that has significantly or may significantly affect the operations of the Group, the results of those operations 
or the state of affairs of the Group in subsequent financial years other than on 1 July 2025 Sonic completed the transaction to 
acquire Laboratory Group Dr. Kramer & Colleagues (‘LADR’) for a cash and debt free enterprise value of €423 million. This was 
satisfied by cash and the issue of 13,833,980 Sonic ordinary shares.

50% of the portion of the target STI award related to qualitative strategic performance conditions (the 20%) is assessed based on 
progress with the Company’s environmental, governance and sustainability objectives, and is assessed against the achievement 
of specific milestones/objectives for the year. For the 2025 year these were: 
 ¡completion of a comprehensive quantitative assessment of Sonic’s climate related risks and opportunities under low (1.5°C 
aligned) and high (3°C+) emissions scenarios over short-term, medium-term and long-term time horizons
 ¡undertake assurance of Sonic’s global scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for FY2025, in preparation for limited 
assurance requirements of mandatory disclosures in FY2026
 ¡monitor and support preparations for upcoming mandatory disclosures including ASRS and California SB253 and SB261 
 ¡oversight of Sonic’s sustainability ratings agency submissions, including annual Climate Disclosure Project (CDP) submission
 ¡progress towards environmental targets
 ¡increased share of renewable energy in total energy consumption
 ¡increased engagement with suppliers on environmental issues
 ¡ensuring appropriate resourcing and organisational structures are in place to progress the Company’s sustainability strategies, 
progress against targets and overall sustainability program maturity. 
These milestones/objectives were achieved.
The other 50% of the relevant portion (20%) of the target STI award was assessed with reference to the following factors:
 ¡promotion of, and adherence to, Sonic Healthcare’s Core Values and Foundation Principles
 ¡the exercise and promulgation of Sonic’s Medical Leadership culture
 ¡the Federation model employed at Sonic Healthcare, and its effective management 
 ¡risk management within the Company
 ¡the external standing and reputation of the Company
 ¡financial leadership and innovation (for the Finance Director).
These ‘qualitative’ factors are not able to be measured in the same way as the EBITDA target. However the Board believes it is 
these factors, and the behaviours and actions that are linked to them, which are the basis of Sonic Healthcare’s success as a 
healthcare provider and as a business. The Board believes that the Company is driven by the ideal of Medical Leadership, which 
means putting the patient and their treating clinician at the centre of all Sonic does. Sonic’s Values and Principles derive from 
Medical Leadership, and the Company’s standing and reputation have been built from it.
