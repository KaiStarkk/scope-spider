Sustainability
In FY25, the Group made meaningful progress across 
its sustainability agenda, the details of which are 
contained in our Sustainability Report which forms 
part of this Annual Report. 
Our carbon footprint increased by 1.8% over the year 
driven by a larger store footprint (+3.4%) and notably 
warmer weather. Operationally, work is underway to 
reduce our Scope 2 emissions through the phased 
installation of solar panels (subject to landlord 
agreement) with two Adairs homemaker stores in 
Frankston and Waurn Ponds completed in FY25, with 
further sites identified for FY26. We also advanced 
our packaging sustainability, replacing problematic 
materials with recyclable or reusable alternatives 
across all product categories, and began reporting 
packaging data by weight and SKU to support APCO 
compliance.
Social responsibility remained a core focus, with 
over $135,000 contributed to Orange Sky through 
product sales and fundraising initiatives, bringing 
our total support since 2019 to more than $1.1 million. 
We also partnered with Red Cross Australia to donate 
over 5,500 kilograms of product, supporting both 
humanitarian efforts and landfill diversion. Internally, 
we strengthened our ethical sourcing and modern 
slavery oversight, improved safety reporting across all 
brands, and achieved our gender diversity targets at 
both Board and executive levels. 
Outlook
The outlook for discretionary retail in Australia is 
improving, supported by stabilising macroeconomic 
conditions and improving consumer sentiment. 
While households remain cautious, rising disposable 
incomes, falling interest rates, and targeted cost-of-
living relief are expected to lift consumer confidence 
and spending. 
My focus as Group CEO is on the matters we can 
control and influence. In the current economic 
environment, we believe consistent and diligent focus 
on ‘the controllables’ will be the most significant 
determinant of our results. With an ongoing focus on 
productivity and disciplined financial management, 
our Group is well positioned to convert future sales 
growth into stronger earnings growth.Internally, I’ve introduced the mantra of moving 
from “Good to Great”, inspired by Jim Collins’ book. 
Our business units are already good, but I firmly 
believe in their potential to be great. I’m grateful for 
the opportunity our leadership team has to lead this 
journey and deeply respect the responsibility we have 
to listen to our customers and teams as we unlock the 
full potential of the Group.
Thank You
As we close out FY25, I want to express my 
sincere thanks to everyone who contributed to our 
performance and is embracing, challenging and 
driving our change program. To our team members, 
whose passion, resilience, and commitment have 
contributed significantly to our results. I’m proud to 
lead such a talented and engaged group. 
I would like to extend my sincere thanks to our Board 
for their guidance and support; and acknowledge 
Mark Ronan for the considered and thorough 
handover he provided me in my transition.
To our suppliers, whose partnership and collaboration 
enable us to bring our products and ideas to life, and 
we deeply value the relationships we’ve built together.
And finally, to our customers, whose continued loyalty 
and trust inspires us to keep improving, innovating, 
and delivering exceptional experiences every day. 
Our role is to help you make your home a place you 
love, and this role is a privilege and something we 
love too.

ADAIRS ANNUAL REPORT 2025

Welcome to the 2025 Sustainability Report.
It is with both passion and purpose that I introduce 
this year’s report — my first as Group CEO. Throughout 
my career in retail, I’ve championed sustainability as 
a core business imperative. To be sustainable is to 
operate in a way that is environmentally, socially, and 
economically responsible — ensuring today’s decisions 
support long-term growth without compromising 
the wellbeing of future generations. At Adairs, I see 
a company with the heart, ambition, and capability 
to be a responsible corporate citizen — one that aligns 
purpose with performance to create lasting value.
Our sustainability efforts are guided by our People, 
Product, and Planet (“PPP”) Committee, a cross-
functional team representing all key areas of the 
business. Their mission is to embed sustainable 
practices across our operations over time.
In absolute terms, the Group’s Scope 1 and 2 
greenhouse gas emissions in 2024 were 1.8% higher 
than in 2023. This increase was primarily driven by 
the expansion of store floor space through new and upsized locations, as well as greater reliance on air 
conditioning due to notably warmer weather conditions 
across all states and territories in 2024. We continue 
to make progress toward our 2030 net-zero target 
for Scope 1 and 2 emissions with the commencement 
of a program to install solar on select properties 
with Frankston and Waurn Ponds in Victoria being 
completed during FY25, and further properties to be 
added in the coming year, subject to landlord approval.
Over the next year we will begin the significant work 
required to measure our Scope 3 emissions which will 
be reported upon from FY27 — these are the indirect 
emissions generated across our value chain. While 
we don’t directly control them, we must take into 
account their impact. These include emissions in areas 
such as our product manufacturing, transportation 
and distribution, team commuting, business travel, 
and the end-of-life disposal of our products. As with 
most retailers, the majority of our emissions sit within 
Scope 3, making it a critical area of focus in our journey 
toward meaningful climate action.“ Being sustainable builds 
shareholder value by ensuring 
we take a long-term view 
of our opportunities and 
risks. It also reinforces our 
social licence to operate by 
demonstrating our strong 
sense of corporate social 
responsibility.” 2025 SUSTAINABILITY

In FY25, Adairs, together with its customers and team, contributed over $135,000 to Orange Sky which, when 
added to prior year contributions, takes Adairs’ total contribution to Orange Sky since 2019 to over $1.1 million. 
For context, this represents a social impact equivalent to:

4.2.2. Supporting others in need
Adairs has proudly partnered with Red Cross Australia 
since 2023 to support both humanitarian efforts 
and environmental sustainability. Select products —
including slightly damaged items, discontinued lines, 
and samples—are collected from our Adairs stores 
and distribution centres and donated to Red Cross for 
resale through their network of over 160 Red Cross 
Shops nationwide.
Proceeds from these sales help fund Red Cross 
programs that assist individuals facing hardship, 
crisis, and disaster. In FY25, Adairs donated 5,563 
kilograms of product through this partnership, 
contributing not only to meaningful social impact 
but also to environmental benefits by diverting waste 
from landfill and reducing CO 2 emissions.
4.3. Supporting our Team 
People are Adairs’ most valuable resource, and the 
Company is committed to providing a safe and healthy 
workplace where all team members are treated with 
dignity and respect. This includes valuing diversity 
and inclusivity and excluding discrimination and 
harassment. Adairs wants its team to be their best 
selves regardless of their gender, age, ethnicity, faith, 
ability, or sexual orientation. It also wants them to be 
engaged and supported in all aspects of their role, 
including their learning and development.

5. Planet
Adairs recognises the importance of minimising the impact that its operations have on the planet through 
reducing its emissions, waste, and energy consumption.
5.1. Climate change
Climate change presents both risks and opportunities for the group, which need to be proactively managed 
to ensure business resilience and alignment with regulatory and consumer expectations in a shifting 
environmental landscape.
5.1.1. Climate change — Governance
The Board oversees climate-related risks and opportunities through the Group’s formal risk management 
framework, as described in section 9 of the Company’s FY25 Corporate Governance Statement.
Adairs’ broader sustainability efforts, which include climate, are overseen on a day-to-day basis by the People, 
Product, and Planet Committee (PPP Committee), which comprises representatives from all business divisions. 
The PPP Committee meets monthly, reports to the Chief Executive Officer (who also attends as an observer), 
and coordinates the identification, development, execution, and review of sustainability initiatives across the 
Group to achieve its sustainability objectives.
5.1.2. Climate change — Risks
Climate change presents identifiable risks across supply chain management, adaptation planning, and stakeholder 
engagement. Adairs is currently collaborating with a climate specialist to identify areas where climate-related 
risks and opportunities may arise and to assess their materiality to the business. This assessment is ongoing, 
and findings will be reported in the FY26 Annual Report.
Climate risks are generally classified into two categories:
Transition risks: These refer to the potential financial and operational impacts that arise from the shift 
toward a lower-carbon economy, including changes in policy, regulation, technology, 
and market preferences.
Physical risks: These refer to the potential impacts resulting from acute events (such as extreme 
weather) and chronic changes (like rising temperatures or sea levels) that can 
directly affect assets, operations, and supply chains.
Adairs has previously identified and reported on key climate-related risks. A qualitative assessment of each 
risk has been conducted, considering both the likelihood of occurrence and the potential financial impact in 
the absence of mitigation or countermeasures. This analysis also evaluates how financial impacts may evolve 
over time under worsening climate conditions.
These risks are currently being reviewed in the context of materiality. A summary of the updated assessment 
will be included in the FY26 Sustainability Report.
