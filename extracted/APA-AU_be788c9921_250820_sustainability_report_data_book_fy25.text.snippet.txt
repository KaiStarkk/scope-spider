APA FY25 Data BookConsolidated Sustainability and Climate Data as well as progress against our Sustainability RoadmapImportant notice
In respect of the scenario analysis disclosed,  there are also inherent limitations with this analysis. It is difficult to predict which, if any, of the scenarios might eventuate. Scenarios do not constitute definitive outcomes or probabilities, and scenario analysis relies on assumptions that may or may not be, or prove to be, correct and may or may not eventuate. Scenarios may also be impacted by additional factors to the assumptions disclosed. Due to the inherent uncertainties and limitations associated with measuring greenhouse gas emissions data, our references to the same are estimates and APA Group Limited does not guarantee the accuracy of the information provided and readers should not place undue reliance on these estimates. The basis for calculation of the emissions data is provided in APA’s FY25 Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Energy Calculation Methodology.   Investors should carefully consider and form their own views as to these matters and any assumptions.This publication contains forward-looking information, including about APA Group, its financial results and other matters, which are subject to risk factors. ‘Forward-looking statements’ may include indications of, and guidance on, future earnings and financial position and performance, statements regarding APA Group’s future strategies and capital expenditure, statements regarding estimates of future demand and consumption, and statements regarding APA’s sustainability and climate transition plans and strategies, the impact of climate change and other sustainability issues for APA, energy transition scenarios, actions of third parties, and external enablers such as technology development and commercialisation, policy support, market support and energy and offsets availability.Forward-looking statements can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as, ‘expect’, ‘anticipate’, ‘likely’, ‘intend’, ‘could’, ‘may’, ‘predict’, ‘plan’, ‘propose’, ‘will’, ‘believe’, ‘forecast’, ‘estimate’, ‘target’, ‘outlook’, ‘guidance’, ‘goal’, ‘ambition’ and other similar expressions and include, but are not limited to, forecast EBIT and EBITDA, free cash flow, operating cash flow, distribution guidance and estimated asset life. Some of these expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements that discuss future expectations concerning sustainability, including climate change and energy transition scenarios and outcomes.At the date of this report, APA Group believes there are reasonable grounds for these forward-looking statements and we have used due care and attention in preparing this report. Forward-looking statements, opinions and estimates are not guarantees or predictions of future performance and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties and other factors.Many of these are beyond our control and may  involve significant elements of subjective judgement and assumptions about future events, which may or may not be correct. There can be  no  assurance that actual outcomes will not  materially differ from these forward-looking statements, opinions and estimates. A number of important factors could cause actual results or performance to differ materially from such forward-looking statements, opinions and estimates.These factors include, but are not limited to, general economic conditions; exchange rates; technological changes; the geopolitical environment; the extent, nature and location of physical impacts of climate change; changes associated with the energy market transition; and government and regulatory intervention, including to limit the impacts of  climate change or manage the impact of Australia’s transitioning energy  system. This FY25 Sustainability Data Book (Data Book) has been prepared for the purpose of providing APA stakeholders with information regarding our approach to sustainability and climate issues related to our business. It has not been prepared as financial, investment or other advice or to provide any guidance in relation to the future position or performance of APA.
