Within the Effective Solutions pillar  
we deepened our technical capabilities  
to support customers to reduce their 
environmental impact. We completed  
life cycle assessments (LCAs) for key 
products, trained our sales teams in 
emissions reduction strategies, and 
continued to support research into 
methane-reducing feed additives.  
While FY25 marked our final year of 
reporting against aquafeed targets  
due to our withdrawal from this market, 
we achieved a 22.5% reduction in 
Fish-in Fish-out (FIFO) ratios, which 
refer to the amount of wild fish used  
to produce a certain amount of  
farmed fish).
Through Meaningful Partnerships,  
we strengthened our commitment  
to our people and communities.  We expanded mental health training, 
enhanced our diversity and inclusion 
initiatives, and increased our financial 
contributions to local communities.  
Our new learning and development 
roadmap, aligned with our FY26 
strategy, ensures we are building  
the future-fit skills our business  
needs to thrive.
Looking ahead to FY26, we will update 
our sustainability baselines to reflect our 
expanded operations and refresh our 
strategy to ensure it remains aligned 
with stakeholder expectations and 
regulatory developments. We are also 
preparing for a full Scope 3 emissions 
assessment and a more detailed 
scenario analysis of climate-related  
risks and opportunities.As we enter this next chapter, I am 
confident that Ridley is well-positioned  
to continue to make progress on  
our Sustainability Commitments.  
Our expanded capabilities, renewed 
focus, and clear strategic direction 
provide a strong foundation from which 
to go forward. I am proud of what we 
have achieved this year and excited 
about the opportunities ahead.
Thank you to our employees, partners, 
and customers for your continued 
support and shared commitment to 
building a more sustainable future.
Sincerely,
Quinton Hildebrand 
Chief Executive Officer  
and Managing Director  
“Our new learning and development roadmap,  
aligned with our FY26 strategy, ensures we are  
building the future-fit skills our business needs  
to thrive.”

Measure and reduce 
greenhouse gas intensity  
of our operations
Optimising the energy used to power  
our mills continues to be a focus at 
Ridley. In FY25, our total Scope 1 GHG 
emissions were 57,081 tCO₂-e, primarily 
from the natural gas and diesel used  
in our operations. Our total Scope 2 
emissions were 50,977 tCO₂-e, resulting 
from electricity consumption at our 
operational sites and office locations. 
These emissions were calculated in 
accordance with the GHG Protocol,  
using emission factors from the National 
Greenhouse and Energy Reporting 
(NGER) Measurement Determination.
Capital projects are enabling us  
to reduce our energy consumption  
and, as a result, our GHG emissions,  
with 4 new projects added in FY25. 
Combined with the 15 projects approved 
in FY24, our total capital expenditure  
on energy reduction projects is now  
$6.1 million. We completed 18 of these 
projects by the end of FY25, resulting  
in an additional reduction of 1.2% GHG 
emissions per tonne of finished product. 
This was achieved through a mix of 
equipment upgrades and optimisation, 
thermal insulation, heat recovery, 
data-driven solutions and  
electrification options.
In the year ahead, we will continue  
to work with the production sites not 
included in the FY23 baseline to align 
their energy and GHG reporting,  
and to identify and develop energy 
efficiency opportunities.3

Case study – Improving energy efficiency through thermal insulation
Detailed assessments have shown that uninsulated pipes can lead to 
significant thermal losses of up to 22%, presenting both economic and 
environmental costs to our business. As such, Ridley engaged a third party  
to supply and install the thermal insulation across 15 of our operating sites  
after successful trials at St Arnaud, Wellsford and Wasleys sites.
The project involved installing thermal insulation on pipework and associated 
equipment identified using thermal imaging audits during normal operations  
at each mill.
While early indications are positive, we will use a third party auditor to  
measure and verify the anticipated energy reduction 12 months after the  
final installation.

In FY24 we engaged an external 
consultant to assess gaps against  
the Australian Sustainability Reporting 
Standards (ASRS) and create a 
compliance roadmap. This year we  
have made progress in addressing  
the identified gaps and actions,  
as detailed in the sections below.
Governance
Since the last report we have  
updated our governance processes, 
including Board governance and 
oversight of climate-related risks  
and opportunities. The new processes 
are described below. 
Strategy
In FY24, our senior management team 
worked with external consultants to 
identify key business functions and 
assess potential physical and transition 
risks. Two climate scenarios were 
evaluated: one with minimal climate 
action leading to significant physical risks, and another aligned with the Paris 
Agreement, reflecting a global transition 
to a low-carbon economy. They identified 
and rated 59 risks and 17 opportunities, 
resulting in 6 priority risks and 5 priority 
opportunities. Details, including mitigation 
actions and outcomes, can be found on 
pages 19-21 in our FY24 report. We plan 
to use these findings in FY26 for a more 
detailed scenario analysis to better 
understand the financial and reputational 
implications for our business.
Risk Management
In FY25 we worked with an external 
consultant to review and update Ridley’s 
Risk Management Program, including  
our Risk Management Framework  
Policy and procedures. A copy of the 
policy can be found on our website. 
Workshops were held with each 
business unit to discuss and agree  
on material risks. Climate-related  
risks, previously considered in  
isolation, were now covered in each 
business unit workshop. These risks were consolidated and prioritised.  
Key strategic risks were identified  
and reported through management  
and committees. Further details of the 
risks can be found in our annual report. 
Risk management of risks is handled 
through our committees; regular 
budgetary, financial and management 
reporting; our organisational structures, 
procedures, manuals, policies, audits 
(including internal and external, 
environmental and safety), insurance 
programs and specialised staff and 
external advisors.
Metrics and targets 
This year we started assessing our  
Scope 3 emissions. This involved 
engaging an external consultant to 
identify our most significant emission 
sources based on the categories  
outlined in the GHG Protocol’s  
Corporate Value Chain Standard.  
This will be used to guide the full 
assessment of our Scope 3  
emissions in FY26.
