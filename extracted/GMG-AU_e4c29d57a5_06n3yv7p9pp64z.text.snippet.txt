Targets and progress
Measurement, reporting, target setting, and monitoring are covered 
in “Quantification of impacts, risks and opportunities ”, supported by 
relevant data and definitions. We provide details on our Scope 1, Scope 
2, and operationally controlled Scope 3 emissions. As our customers 
typically control building operations within our industrial and data centre 
properties, our current Scope 3 list is limited but will expand to include 
embodied carbon from development as data becomes available.
We believe that the way to measure the true sustainability of our activities 
is in relation to the overall impact on the economy and planet. This is best 
done through a lens of total economic output and the energy efficiency 
of those activities. We are considering methods by which to reflect this, 
but have identified the intensity of CO2 per unit of economic output as a 
potential metric. If this is not practical, an alternative or newly developed 
intensity measure that accurately represents our activities will be sought. 
This is important to enable us to find the right strategies for the future so 
we can deploy capital in a way that is aligned with our long-term goals.
The key targets and initiatives are included in the " Performance 
reporting " section of this report. Some of these are under review given the 
changes in our business, the consideration of relative intensity measures, 
technology, legislation and market practices. The targets and initiatives 
are categorised as follows:
Climate related:
+ Emission reduction within our Scope 1, Scope 2 and selected Scope 3 
based on operational control
+ Sourcing renewable energy
+ Continuing to install PV capacity on site
+ Emission reduction in embodied carbon from development
+ Maintenance of high occupancy in the portfolio
+ Climate scenario analysis ongoing to manage hazard risks
+ Monitoring and management of the impacts on nature 
and biodiversity.
Non-climate related:
+ Health and safety of workers
+ Sustainable sourcing through our supply chain
+ Diversity of workforce
+ Capital management practices
+ Social contributions
+ Workplace culture
+ Compliance with legislative and corporate requirements.Link between business and sustainability strategy
Our annual business strategy integrates Goodman’s sustainability 
objectives from the 2030 Sustainability Strategy. These objectives are 
consistent with our desire to generate financially attractive outcomes 
over the long term. It was established in 2019 and captures the 
sustainability priorities of our global business, and accounts for the major 
priorities of our customers and long-term investment partners.
Our sustainability report includes consideration and discussion of 
sustainability risks and opportunities of a material nature that have been 
identified by management and the Group's approach to them – this 
includes climate risks and opportunities.

Risk/opportunity Description Initiatives
Physical damage to buildings Hazards such as floods, heat, storms Location selection and building specifications are considered. We continue to 
perform analysis to consider potential losses and make modifications to the 
portfolio as required. We also insure against a wide range of potential events.
Refer to " Business impact quantification" section below for climate exposure 
assessment, which considers medium and longer-term impacts under various 
climate scenarios (including business-as-usual, medium, and strong carbon 
mitigation scenarios).
Building specification is too low to 
meet industry sustainability standards 
impacting customer, investor and 
financier demandEnergy, waste, water, worker comfort In contributing to the carbon reduction ambitions of the global economy, 
including addressing our own emission reduction plans, we have taken a 
building life cycle approach to the review of climate in most regions to see 
where we can reduce upfront and operational carbon emissions. This life cycle 
approach also supports our customers and investors to meet their emission 
reduction targets.
We make investments in sustainability that are commercially viable and 
technically achievable on both existing assets and new developments. Where 
properties are likely to be redeveloped within a foreseeable time frame, the 
investment is deferred until that time.
Emissions within our portfolio and 
corporate activities are too highGHG emissions (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) Scope 1 , Scope 2 and limited component of Scope 3 (refer definition 
in the " Quantification of impacts, risks and opportunities" section): These 
are items we have operational control over. We aim to make progress by 
using a combination of methods ranging from generating and/or purchasing 
renewable energy, energy efficiency measures, behavioural change and 
consider purchasing offsets when appropriate.
Remaining Scope 3 items (excluded from the items above): Emissions 
predominantly outside of our operational control. We do not have an exclusion 
policy in respect of customer emissions (i.e. downstream leased assets). Their 
energy use, as this is not necessarily the signal of inefficiency in either their 
operations or our buildings. We choose customers who we believe offer a 
viable product or service and are themselves viable. This involves taking a 
view on their ongoing ability to pay rent by reviewing their financial position, 
business strategy and approach to sustainability as a whole. We do work with 
our customers to find ways to promote energy efficiency through building 
design and inclusions.
Apart from the measurement of embodied carbon in our developments, we 
also encourage the creation of lower emissions alternatives that are viable and 
can meet our structural needs by participating in experimental activities and 
working with suppliers to investigate options. At this point there is no clear 
pathway for certain low carbon products such as steel or concrete that we 
can ascribe either a value or a time horizon to, but we will seek to use the 
appropriate products and methods as they become available.
The concept of emissions from sold products is not useful in understanding the 
Group's sustainability. The future uses of our assets are not predictable and 
the variability of the sales activity is low. As a result, we exclude this from our 
calculations and targets.
All other Scope 3 items are immaterial to our business.
Poor financial performance may 
impact on our access to capital and 
inhibit our ability to manage climate 
risks and opportunitiesLoss of support from financiers and 
investorsMaintain strong focus on achieving financial performance targets while 
containing financial risks.
Culture can impact on reputation and 
ability to continue to operateEmployee behaviour may impact on 
performance, leading to complacency 
which may have a detrimental impact 
on our social licence and subsequently 
investor support.
Our values incorporate inclusion and 
diversity as well as safety, so we seek 
to align our culture in a manner that 
can address these risks.
A broader risk management 
framework exists which includes items 
relevant to sustainability (including 
climate).Appropriately align our employees with our strategic intent and expected 
standards through remuneration policies, training and support.
Our community investments such as donations of time and/or money to 
charitable organisations.
We have a sustainable sourcing framework that takes human rights 
into consideration.

Quantification of impacts, risks and opportunities
Emissions
Goodman sees emission reduction as a priority, and we have set ourselves targets to help achieve this. We aim to make progress by using a 
combination of methods ranging from renewable energy sources and energy efficiency measures to behavioural change. In each instance, we are 
guided by availability of market solutions, practicality of implementation, and economic rationality. When applying time frames, we consider the 
expected life of the investment. While reducing our emissions remains a priority, Goodman may consider carbon offsets to supplement our emissions 
reduction activities and accommodate for market and product limitations.
When considering carbon emissions from our operations we are focused on Scope 1 and Scope 2, as well as the various components of Scope 3 (as 
defined in Note 3 of the table overleaf). We are reviewing the appropriate reporting and targets associated with Scope 3 emissions and aim to comply 
with the impending Australian Accounting Standards Board disclosure requirements as soon as practically possible.
Goodman uses the Climate Active Carbon Neutral Standard for Organisations to help manage and calculate greenhouse gas emissions that occur as 
a result of our operations. It certifies organisations which measure, reduce, and offset carbon emissions in accordance with their standard. Climate 
Active defines carbon neutral as: "Reducing emissions where possible and compensating for the remainder by investing in carbon offset projects to 
achieve net zero overall emissions . Offsets are generated from an activity that prevents, reduces or removes greenhouse gas emissions from being 
released into the atmosphere.”
For Group reporting of our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions reduction and renewable energy targets, we use the GHG protocol to measure the items 
within our emissions boundary. Our emissions boundary is based on an operational control approach, including activities in those areas of our property 
portfolio where we have control over day-to-day operations and our corporate activities, including some Scope 3 emissions (refer to "GHG Scope" 
table). It excludes other sources of Scope 3 emissions such as emissions from our customers’ activities within leased areas, and the embodied 
emissions from developments.
We expect to maintain our status as a Carbon Neutral Organisation for our global operations in FY25 under Climate Active. As part of our 
commitment, we annually report our operational carbon inventory to Climate Active for verification. For reporting purposes, we take into account 
100% of the emissions within our defined boundary, irrespective of our share of equity ownership in the properties. We continue to look for ways to 
lower our operational emissions and increase our use of renewable electricity. Purchasing certified GreenPower electricity in our Australian operations 
and using renewable energy certificates have been key factors. To meet our commitment, we intend to purchase Australian Carbon Credit Units 
(ACCUs) to offset our residual operational emissions - for more information relating to renewable energy certificates and ACCU sources, please refer 
to Climate Active’s website. We note that Climate Active is considering a change to the future direction of the program, and we will monitor any 
potential changes.
Our annual operational emissions are included in the following table.

1Data tables, including any estimates used, may be updated as more current data becomes available.
2At the time of writing, FY25 data is in the process of verification by qualified independent third parties and final data will be updated on our website. Until then, data should be considered to 
include estimates.
3Our emissions boundary is based on an operational control approach (we refer to the GHG Protocol), including Scope 3 emissions relating to transmission and distribution of energy, waste, water use, 
data servers, staff commuting, working from home, business travel, advertising, cleaning, telecommunications, and other corporate expenses. For the purpose of this report, other scope 3 items, such as 
future emissions from sold products, embodied carbon from developments and customer emissions data have not been included. We are however tracking these and are continuing to develop better 
methods of capturing and reporting. We are also working on strategies to manage the emerging risks and opportunities (as outlined in the preceding sections).
4Data derived from invoices and meter readings are the primary method used for validation. Where required due to timing, new acquisitions or developments, and site and meter access, estimates are 
used based on extrapolation or prior period comparisons.
5Goodman reports both location and market-based electricity emissions. Under the market-based approach, calculations for electricity emissions include the use of market-based instruments such as 
the retirement of renewable energy certificates. Location-based emissions reporting is based on average energy generation emission factors for defined locations.
By procuring renewable electricity (and using market-based instruments), we have reduced our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by -90% relative to 
the 2021 baseline year. The resumption of travel following the period that was heavily impacted by the pandemic, has resulted in an increase in Scope 
3 emissions within our operational boundary. Overall, emissions within our operational boundary under the market-based measure are down -64% 
since 2021.
