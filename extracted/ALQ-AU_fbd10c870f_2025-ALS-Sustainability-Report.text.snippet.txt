Progress underpinned  
by innovation 
Innovation is core to everything we do.  
It enables us to lead in a constantly evolving world and adapt to the needs of our clients, communities and environment.It helps us to work more efficiently,  deliver cutting-edge solutions, and push the boundaries on what’s possible. Whether it’s evolving our sustainability initiatives, progressing our Net Zero program, or driving meaningful progress across our teams – innovation underpins every step forward.
In FY25, we embraced new technologies 
and adopted more sustainable practices that are enhancing our operations and ways of working globally. This continual process strengthens our commitment to sustainability, improves safety, and elevates the services we provide to  our clients. 
But innovation isn’t just about technology. It flourishes in a culture that encourages fresh thinking and bold ideas. That’s why we actively foster curiosity within our teams, empowering them to challenge conventions and explore new possibilities. This mindset underpins our 2029 Roadmap to Win and sustainability program, positioning us to meet the challenges ahead with creative, real-world solutions, while remaining aligned with our core values. We know that every failure is a learning opportunity, and by learning faster, we adapt and improve at a greater pace. 
A commitment to our people
Our people are the driving force behind ALS’ success. This year, we placed even greater emphasis on workplace safety and wellbeing, maintaining our industry-leading safety performance and enhancing our Life Saving Rules program. Our commitment to our core value ‘safe’ remains unwavering, because our priority is ensuring our people return home safely every day.Beyond physical safety, we prioritised building a workplace where everyone feels supported and valued. Mental health, inclusion and respect are key to this, and we continue to invest in programs that build inclusive teams, support personal development and celebrate contributions – whether through sustainability and innovation awards, employee initiatives and career growth opportunities.
Building a more inclusive organisation 
is central to our values and brings us together as one ALS. A diverse and inclusive workplace drives new ideas, unlocks fresh perspectives and fuels the kind innovation that keep us at the forefront of our industry.
Meaningful action  
for our planet 
We believe that we have a role to play in 
building a more sustainable world. That’s why we’re taking decisive action to reduce our carbon footprint and drive meaningful change. This year, we made significant progress on our Net Zero Program and have achieved a 56 per cent reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions since 2020.
But our environmental responsibility goes beyond carbon reduction. We expanded our efforts with new pilot programs to better track water and waste emissions, and installed five new solar energy PV systems, bringing our total to over 28 since 2020. We also took further steps to improve energy efficiency across our laboratories, increasing the adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles in our fleet, conducting energy audits at larger facilities and implementing energy-saving measures. Strengthening  
community connection 
Supporting the communities where we 
live and work remains central to our sustainability approach. In FY25, we expanded our partnerships with schools and universities to promote STEM education and inspire the next generation of scientific leaders. We also developed a new workplace volunteering program framework that will be rolled out in FY26, providing our employees with greater opportunities to give back and create lasting, positive impact. These efforts are testament to the values that define our company. By working closely with local organisations, we are driving positive, sustainable change that benefits everyone. 
Looking ahead
We take pride in the progress we’ve made and remain energised and committed to challenging ourselves to continue leading with purpose.
I’d like to extend my personal gratitude to 
our employees, clients and stakeholders for their ongoing support and shared commitment to sustainability. I’m confident that together, we will keep driving progress, embracing innovation and building a better world through science, assurance and sustainability.

ALS SUSTAINABILITY REPORT 2025
21Sustainability at ALS
Our Sustainability Program is driven by our purpose 
‘to help make the world a better place through science, assurance and sustainability’, guiding our efforts to create positive impacts for our people, the planet and the communities we’re part of, underpinned by ethical business practices. 
For our people, this means fostering a safe, 
inclusive workplace where everyone can grow and succeed, regardless of gender, ethnicity or sexual orientation. For our planet, we’re committed to protecting the environment and minimising our footprint for future generations. For our communities, we’re focused on building meaningful partnerships with local suppliers and organisations to contribute to shared value. Our approach is grounded in strong governance, ethical practices and leadership, ensuring we operate with integrity and uphold the highest standards in all that we do. Through these guiding principles, we aim to create lasting, sustainable value for our employees, clients, communities and stakeholders.
In FY25, ALS further incorporated sustainability 
considerations in our 2029 Roadmap to Win, which included setting an objective of creating a sustainability advantage. We also took meaningful steps across our four sustainability pillars—people, planet, community and business practices—progressing a number of key initiatives. 
These efforts underscore our commitment to 
creating lasting, sustainable value while fulfilling our responsibilities to our teams, the environment and the communities we serve. Looking ahead, we have set measurable targets to track the success of our sustainability strategy. By FY27, ALS aims to contribute to a better world by achieving key outcomes across the four pillars of our sustainability program, including:
