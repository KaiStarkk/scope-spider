Message from Group CEO
The culmination of our expanded Environmental, Social and 
Governance (ESG) agenda, together with the advancements 
made in our disclosures, saw Metcash achieve its highest ever 
result under the Dow Jones Sustainability Index’s Corporate 
Sustainability Assessment (international Food and Staples 
Retailing). Its assessment placed Metcash in the 87th percentile 
of the index, which is a substantial increase from the 69th 
percentile in the prior year.
Pleasingly, we also received a B-rating by the Carbon Disclosure 
Project, a marked increase from previous years. This recognised 
our improved actions towards understanding and addressing 
our climate-related risks and Scope 3 emissions. 
Climate change remains a pressing concern and our consistent 
efforts to mitigate its impacts are evident in our focus on 
energy efficiency and aligning fully to the Taskforce on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). We also remain 
committed to adopting the International Sustainability 
Standards Board (ISSB) standards when they become 
applicable for Metcash, which we anticipate is the 2025 
financial year.
Part of our advancements in disclosure includes this year’s 
Sustainability Report being referenced to the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI) and related index, in line with the commitment 
we made last year. 
We remain committed to our 2040 net-zero emissions 
reduction target for Scope 1 and 2, and this year reduced 
emissions in line with the trend required to reach our target. 
We commissioned a 782kwp solar system at our main 
distribution centre at Huntingwood (NSW) and will transition 
all our operational control sites to renewable energy by 2025. 
We have committed these same sites to a waste-to-landfill 
avoidance target of 80% by 2028, addressing what our 
stakeholders have indicated is their second-most material issue. 
I believe that independent retailers are a national treasure 
and should be supported to continue to add materially to the 
Australian economy and society. Championing Successful 
Independents is our purpose, and our strategy. Their 
unwavering support for local communities and the vital role 
they play was evidenced in a recently commissioned economic 
report on IGA. It found that IGA supports ~34,000 local organisations with 
$194m of financial, time and in-kind support. Since 2010 more 
than 25,000 donations have been made to local grassroots 
organisations and national charity partners totalling more 
than $37m.
Another significant milestone this year was the establishment 
of a sustainable finance facility of $525m, linking finance costs 
with our sustainability credentials.
Our fight against modern slavery continues to be a priority. 
We are committed to ensuring that our supply chains are 
ethical, and we are continuing to work closely with our partners 
to address any concerns in this area.
The safety, wellbeing and growth of our people remain at the 
forefront. Our initiatives in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
and our efforts to foster a safe working environment are 
reflective of this commitment. Pleasingly, we received our 
fifth consecutive citation as an employer of choice by the 
Gender Equality Agency Employer of Choice for Gender and 
we have achieved our 40/40/20 target at the Board and Group 
Leadership levels. We also saw a 34% improvement in our key 
safety measure of Total Recordable Frequency Rate.
Going forward, our determination to play a pivotal role in 
creating a sustainable future for all remains unwavering. I am 
optimistic about the path ahead and deeply grateful for the 
collective effort of our people, partners and stakeholders. 
Thank you for being a part of this journey and I trust you find 
this year’s report informative.
Doug Jones  
Group CEOWelcome to our Sustainability 
Report for 2023. As we continue 
the journey towards our vision 
of creating a sustainable future, I 
am proud to share the significant 
achievements made by Metcash 
over the past year.

As Australia’s largest wholesaler, 
we understand the role we play 
in minimising environmental 
and climate impacts across not 
only our own operations, but the 
entire supply chain in which we 
play a part.
Our Corporate Vision includes ‘creating a sustainable future’, 
and this involves working closely with our retailers and their 
communities, as well as suppliers, to mitigate the impact across 
all areas of the business. 
This year represents a milestone for Metcash from a 
climate-related reporting perspective. After three years of 
preparatory work, we now have full coverage and alignment 
to all sections of the Taskforce for Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD) standard. This was reviewed and confirmed 
by E Y.
The year also included working towards achieving our emissions 
reductions target for Scope 1 and 2, with energy efficiency 
projects and the expansion of solar power at our distribution 
centres being key drivers. 
Beyond our own footprint, we recalculated Scope 3 emissions 
using more recent and expanded data sources and we 
promoted free energy and waste audits for independent 
retail stores within our network. Our Planet

The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 
synthesis report released in March 2023 stated that: “Human 
activities have unequivocally caused global warming and that 
unsustainable energy use, land use and land use change, and the 
lifestyles and patterns of consumption and production globally, 
have contributed to the rising greenhouse gas emissions that 
have caused this warming.”2
While global surface temperatures have risen by 1.1°C in 
Australia, our climate has already warmed by 1.5°C on average. 
This means Australia faces a greater risk of facing the impacts 
of climate change sooner with shifting rainfall patterns, an 
increase in extreme heat events associated with this warming, 
and heavy rainfall events already becoming more intense.3
To limit warming to 1.5°C globally, we must achieve net-zero 
carbon dioxide emissions in the early 2050s. We have adopted, 
and made progress against, the following targets in line with 
the Science-Based Target methodology:
 –A 10
% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2025 
(against a 2020 emissions baseline)
 –A 20
30 Scope 1 and 2 Science-Based Target of 42% 
reduction in GHG emissions by 2030, using a 2020 
baseline, aligned to the 1.5°C warming scenario of 
the Paris Agreement
 –A 10
0% renewable energy target by 2025
 –A ne
t-zero emissions target by 2040
We have met our interim GHG emissions target for FY23 
by improving energy efficiency, reducing our Scope 2 grid 
emissions, installing more on-site solar, and further developing 
energy management both on-site and off-site. The graphic 
below indicates the impact of the changes made to date in 
our net-zero journey and outlines the remaining work.

2. Looking forward
We recognise the risks that climate change poses to our supply chain and our ability to service our customers. We continue to support 
the decarbonisation of our industry and build business resilience to adapt to a changing economy and physical environment. As we 
continue our alignment with the TCFD and further our understanding and management of climate change impacts on, and by, our 
business, we will seek to maintain focus in the following areas: This year we established an Energy Steering Committee 
that meets to discuss energy efficiency improvements 
and opportunities in the organisation in response to the 
rising energy costs and the broader environmental impact. 
Doing so is financially pragmatic and an essential part 
of responsible business practice to address our climate 
footprint. The Committee consists of function leaders from 
Risk and Compliance, Operations, Facilities, Sustainability, 
and third-party energy specialists. 
The ESG Council presented an in-depth and costed analysis 
of major energy efficiency initiatives to the Chief Financial 
Officer for evaluation and consideration. These initiatives were 
developed through desktop and physical audits of our sites 
by our third-party energy consulting partner and focused on 
understanding our sites (management, maintenance schedules, 
performance, asset life expectancy), the technology available to 
us to make efficiency improvements, and successful examples 
already in use. 
Our progress on other initiatives across packaging and waste, 
responsible procurement and striving for 5-star Green Star 
Building rating on our new Mega Distribution Centre in Victoria 
all contribute to our broader net-zero emissions targets.Action Status
