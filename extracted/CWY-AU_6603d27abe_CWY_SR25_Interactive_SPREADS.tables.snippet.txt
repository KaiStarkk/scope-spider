Cleanaway’s targets are benchmarked against our FY22 gross Scope 1 and 2,,
emissions baseline and aim for a 43% reduction in carbon dioxide and a 34%,,
reduction in methane by 2030. These goals can be met on a gross or on a net,,

•  ACCUs issued from registered abatement projects,,

for net emissions).,,
"To incentivise achievement of the targets, a long‑term incentive (LTI) linked to methane",,
,"1.5°C ambition
Governance, accountability and transparency",
emissions reduction was introduced in FY23 and remained in place each year since.,,
We are proud to be a company delivering emissions reductions and continue,,
