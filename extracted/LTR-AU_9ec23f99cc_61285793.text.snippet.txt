Sustainability Report 
From the Chair of the Sustainability Committee
FY25	marked	Liontown’s 	first	year	of	operation	at	Kathleen	 Valley,	an	
important milestone in our journey from project development to producer. 
This new phase brought greater responsibility, together with the opportunity 
to demonstrate that sustainability is not a parallel function; it is embedded in 
how we operate, engage, and create long-term value.
People are central to everything we do. In FY25, we prioritised safety as 
our highest operational focus and continued to embed a proactive safety 
culture across both our workforce and contracting partners. While our TRIFR 
saw a minor increase as total hours worked post-construction reduced, we 
maintained a strong commitment to continuous improvement and learning.  
We broadened our focus to include mental health and psychological safety, a 
key to building a resilient workforce.
We strengthened our relationships with Native Title Holders through culturally 
appropriate engagement, expanded employment and business participation, 
and progressed initiatives that support long-term community partnerships. Our 
approach continues to be guided by the principles of Free, Prior and Informed 
Consent and we believe that working in genuine partnership creates lasting 
value for Aboriginal communities and the regions that support our operations.
We focused on optimising groundwater resources and progressed the 
development	 of	a	long-term	 water	strategy 	to	ensure	sustainable 	borefield 	
operation alongside reliable water supply for our site. Our understanding of the 
surrounding ecosystems continued to deepen through vegetation health studies 
and collaborative environmental surveys with Tjiwarl Native Title Holders ensuring 
the inclusion of traditional ecological knowledge. We also initiated planning with 
Zenith to trial mitigation measures aimed at reducing impacts on avian fauna and 
bat	species. 	These	efforts	reflect	our	commitment	to 	responsible 	water	use 	and	
biodiversity protection as we transition to steady-state operations.
In FY25, we strengthened our climate change response by publishing a Climate, 
Energy and Emissions Policy and committing to a comprehensive Climate, Energy 
and Greenhouse Gas Strategy. The hybrid power station averaged 81% renewable 
penetration at our operation, whilst we implemented a robust emissions data 
management system to track Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. Work commenced on 
pilot	programs 	to	assess	low-emission	fleet	technologies 	and	studies 	into	battery	
storage	solutions 	to	support	future 	electrification. 	Looking	ahead, 	we	will	finalise 	
our Scope 3 emissions inventory, advance climate governance systems in line with 
AASB	S2	requirements 	and	finalise 	our	decarbonisation	strategy.
Adrienne Parker  
Chair of the Sustainability Committee
As Chair of the 
Sustainability 
Committee at 
Liontown Resources, 
I am proud to 
present our FY25 
Sustainability Report, 
a	reflection	 of	our	
commitment to 
being a responsible 
operator. Sustainability Report
Strong governance underpins all  
our sustainability efforts. In FY25,  
we laid the groundwork for ISO 14001  
(Environmental Management 
Systems) accreditation and 
commenced	planning	for	 our	first	
modern slavery statement. We 
also aligned internal processes to 
support upcoming climate disclosure 
obligations under AASB S2 and to 
ensure our strategy is effectively 
implemented and monitored we have 
enhanced our Environmental, Social, 
Governance and Economic (ESGE), 
systems and frameworks across the 
business.
As Chair of the Sustainability 
Committee, I’m proud of how we’ve 
embedded ESGE principles across 
Liontown, from boardroom decisions to frontline delivery. These principles 
don’t just shape our obligations; they 
guide how we lead, how we partner, 
and	how 	we	define	success. 	
As part of our ongoing growth and 
commitment to transparency, we 
have transitioned to including our 
sustainability disclosures in our 
Annual Report and are pleased 
to	introduce 	Liontown’s 	first	ESG	
Data Book. This new ESG Data 
Book is a resource that represents 
the next chapter in our maturity 
journey, offering stakeholders a 
transparent and accessible view of 
our performance metrics across key 
ESG indicators. The ESG Data Book 
complements our narrative reporting 
by providing detailed, comparable 
data that supports informed decision-making	and	reflects 	our	commitment	
to accountability. It is a foundational 
step towards enhanced disclosure and 
continuous improvement, aligned with 
global best practice and stakeholder 
expectations.
In FY26, we will build on the 
foundations we have established, and 
we will continue to strengthen our 
systems and demonstrate ongoing 
transparency. We do this because we 
believe delivering value the right way 
is the only way.

Our approach to sustainability 
Liontown’s approach to sustainability ensures clear 
accountability and integration across all levels of our 
business. The Board of Directors holds ultimate oversight, 
reviewing and approving our strategy, targets, and 
disclosures. To support this, the Sustainability Committee 
provides focused oversight on material ESGE risks and 
opportunities, reviewing key policies and initiatives. The 
Executive Leadership Team (ELT) is responsible for driving 
implementation across the organisation, embedding 
sustainability into core business planning. The Head 
of Sustainability, Compliance and Strategy leads the 
development and execution of our approach, advising 
the Board of Directors and ELT, and coordinating cross-
functional initiatives to ensure regulatory compliance 
and building organisational capability. Implementation 
is carried out by operational teams, who integrate ESGE 
requirements into day-to-day activities. These teams 
deliver on targets, and provide the data needed to support 
informed decision making for continuous improvement and 
reporting.
Materiality 
In FY24, we conducted our biennial formal materiality 
assessment	to 	determine 	Liontown’s 	most	significant	
sustainability impacts for reporting and to guide the 
Company’s 	Sustainability 	Strategy. 	In	FY25, 	reflecting	 on	
our transition from construction to operations, and the 
change in scope and impact of our activities, we undertook 
a	materiality 	refresh	to 	review	and	validate	the	findings 	of	
our FY24 assessment. 
Prospective material topics were derived from frameworks 
such as the GRI Standards 2021, the GRI 14: Mining Sector 
Standard 2024, the SASB Metals and Mining Sustainability 
Accounting Standards, and the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs). The methodology included 
interviews with key internal and external stakeholders, and 
a survey open to all Liontown employees and contractors.All stakeholders were asked to prioritise material topics 
based on the severity and likelihood of impacts. They 
were also encouraged to consider where Liontown was 
performing well and where opportunities existed for 
improvement. This approach provided valuable insights into 
both current performance and opportunities to enhance 
sustainability outcomes. The results of the materiality 
refresh have been endorsed by the Board of Directors and 
ELT and updated material topics include:
• Governance
 Child labour, forced labour and modern slavery,  
freedom of association, non-discrimination and equal 
opportunity, anti-corruption
• Biodiversity and Environmental Compliance
 Air emissions, biodiversity and environmental compliance
• Decarbonisation and Climate Change Adaptation
 Greenhouse gas (GHG), emissions and climate adaptation 
and resilience
• Water Management

Liontown’s approach to 
sustainability ensures clear 
accountability and integration 
across all levels of our 
business. 
Governance 
The integrity of our Sustainability Strategy is underpinned by 
robust governance mechanisms and a strong commitment 
to responsible business conduct. At Liontown, we take 
a top-down approach to continuously strengthening 
governance across all areas of the business, ensuring our 
strategy remains resilient, credible, and aligned with our 
long-term sustainability goals. Liontown has implemented a 
corporate governance framework aimed at ensuring effective 
management, compliance with regulatory requirements, and 
alignment with stakeholder expectations. We are committed 
to fostering a culture of accountability, integrity, and 
transparency, recognising that strong corporate governance is 
essential to our long-term success. It provides the foundation 
for effective decision-making, ensures ethical and responsible 
operations, and safeguards the interests of all stakeholders.
Board and Committees 
Liontown’s Board of Directors, comprising both Executive 
and Non-Executive Directors, is accountable to shareholders 
for the Company’s performance over both the short and 
long term. The Board provides leadership and oversight 
of	the	Company’s 	management. 	It	defines	the	Company’s 	
purpose, sets strategic priorities, and regularly monitors 
management’s progress toward achieving these priorities. 
Our Board members serve on key Board level committees, 
which include the Sustainability Committee, Remuneration 
and Nominations Committee, and Audit and Risk 
Committee. 
Sustainability Committee
The Sustainability Committee, in conjunction with the  
Audit and Risk Committee, oversees the Company’s 
performance and management of sustainability risks in 
relation to environment and climate change, community 
and social engagement, health, safety and wellbeing,  
and responsible business (including modern slavery and 
human rights issues) and reporting/disclosure. The Sustainability Committee is supported by the Head of 
Sustainability, Strategy and Compliance. 
Audit and Risk Committee
The Audit and Risk Committee oversees the Company’s 
financial	reporting, 	accounting	policies, 	and	audit	activities 	
to ensure the integrity and transparency of disclosures. It 
reviews	the	effectiveness 	of	internal	financial	 controls	and	
the	accuracy 	of	financial	statements. 	The	Committee 	also	
monitors the Company’s risk and compliance frameworks, 
including key policies, risk appetite, and any material risk 
exposures.
Remuneration and Nomination Committee
The Remuneration and Nomination Committee oversees 
the Company’s remuneration framework, processes for 
selection, appointment and evaluation of directors and 
senior executives, and the composition, diversity and 
effectiveness of the Board in discharging its duties. 
Each committee operates under a Board-approved charter 
that outlines its purpose, structure, and responsibilities. 
The process for nominating and selecting Board members 
is guided by our formal policy on the appointment of 
directors and senior executives.
In FY26, to further improve our governance processes, 
we will establish dedicated Continuous Disclosure and 
Sustainability Working Group sub-committees, led by 
executive and senior management teams. The sub-
committees will provide an opportunity for Liontown’s 
staff to participate in shaping and advancing the Comany’s 
strategic path.
