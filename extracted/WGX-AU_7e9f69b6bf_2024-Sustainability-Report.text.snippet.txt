For example, water scarcity, a significant concern for dust 
suppression and processing activities, is being addressed 
through water-saving initiatives such as recycling and 
reuse. To safeguard worker safety, we are implementing 
protocols to mitigate heat stress and developing 
emergency response plans for flooding and limited access 
during extreme weather events.
To reduce our carbon footprint, we are implementing 
energy efficiency improvements, electrification, and water 
conservation measures. Additionally, we are exploring 
opportunities arising from the shift towards a low-carbon 
economy, such as increased demand for gold as a safe-
haven asset and its role in clean energy technologies.
4.2.2 Decarbonising our operations 
The mining industry is undergoing a rapid transition 
towards decarbonisation. Westgold is actively responding 
to this challenge by reducing our carbon footprint and 
optimising energy consumption. Our achievements 
include a 2.4% decrease in emissions intensity per 
ounce of gold produced and an 8.3% reduction in 
overall emissions in FY24. Key initiatives driving this 
progress include the electrification of our operations, 
the integration of renewable energy sources, and the 
adoption of energy-efficient technologies. 
Collaborating with industry peers and environmental 
organisations is essential for accelerating progress. For 
example, our collaboration with Pacific Energy has led to 
the construction of hybrid power stations, significantly 
reducing our reliance on diesel fuel. Additionally, we 
have partnered with WesTrac to pilot hybrid underground 
loaders, and with Southern Mining Electrical Contractors 
to implement ventilation-on-demand systems.2020 2021 2022 2023 20240.70.73

4.2.3 Climate resilience
Climate change presents a complex challenge for 
Westgold, bringing both risks and opportunities. 
Increased heatwaves, droughts, floods, and bushfires can 
disrupt operations, damage infrastructure, and endanger 
workers. Westgold’s approach focuses on building 
resilience through strategies such as:
 – Implementing energy-saving measures and exploring 
clean energy sources such as solar power to reduce 
reliance on traditional fuels.
 – Water recycling, investigating alternative dust 
suppression methods, and exploring ways to diversify 
water sources are all part of Westgold’s water 
stewardship efforts.
 – Maintaining a heat stress protocol with hydration 
stations, shaded areas, and flexible work schedules 
will be developed, alongside employee training.
 – Conducting vulnerability assessments to identify 
areas susceptible to extreme heat damage, with 
upgrades or modifications planned within three years.
 –Implementing a bushfire plan with evacuation 
procedures, communication protocols, and employee 
training, along with regular fire drills.
 – Collaborating with neighbouring communities 
to develop a water management plan that 
addresses the needs of both the mine and local 
communities, fostering sustainable water resource 
management in the region.Westgold’s progress
Recommendation Our current approach Achievements in FY24 Actions for FY25+
Governance Disclose the organisation’s 
governance around climate-
related risks and opportunitiesEnvironmental, Social and 
Governance Policy sets out our 
approach and expectations with 
respect to climate change across 
the business. 
The Sustainability Committee of 
the Westgold Board oversees the 
management of climate change 
and climate-related risks and 
opportunities. This committee 
is supported by our ESG 
Working Group.  – Assessment of 
company decision-
making and capital 
allocation processes 
for consideration and 
alignment with climate 
risk management 
processes. – Increase engagement 
with stakeholders, 
including investors, 
employees, and 
communities, to gather 
feedback on climate-
related initiatives and 
ensure transparency.
Strategy Disclose the actual and 
potential impacts of climate-
related risks and opportunities 
on the organisation’s 
businesses, strategy and 
financial planning where such 
information is material. We have performed a high-level 
assessment of the potential 
climate-related risks and 
opportunities for our business 
and disclosed these in our FY21 
Sustainability Report. – Development of a 
Climate Change Action 
Plan.
 – Delivery of emissions 
reductions across the 
business by investing in 
renewable energy. – Identify and 
evaluate additional 
opportunities that 
align with Westgold’s 
business strategy and 
sustainability goals.
Risk 
Management Disclose how the organisation 
identifies, assesses and 
managed climate-related risks. Climate-related risks are 
identified and assessed as part 
of Westgold’s Risk Management 
Framework. We continue to 
embed systems to improve the 
integration and understanding of 
climate risk across our business.  –Identification of key risks 
as part of the Climate 
Change Action Plan. – Integration of risk 
assessment outcomes 
into company 
risk management 
processes.
Metrics 
and targets Disclose the metrics and 
targets used to assess and 
manage relevant climate-
related risks and opportunities 
where such information is 
material. Westgold currently monitors 
GHG emissions (Scope 1 and 2), 
number of heat-related illnesses 
and total costs incurred due to 
extreme climate-related events. – Establishment of 
emissions reduction 
goals and targets. – Undertake a readiness 
assessment, gap 
analysis, and roadmap 
to address the incoming 
Australian Sustainability 
Reporting Standards.
Table 3: Westgold’s Progress with the Recommendations of the TCFD4.2.4 Improving our climate disclosures 
To strengthen our climate-related governance and risk management processes and enhance our disclosure practices, we 
have been taking steps towards alignment with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework. 
Our progress is outlined in Table 3 below. We are also working towards mandatory reporting against the new AASB S2 
climate disclosure standard in FY26.
