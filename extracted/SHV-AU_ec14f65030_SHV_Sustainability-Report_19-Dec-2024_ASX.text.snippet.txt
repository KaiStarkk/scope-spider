Select Harvests  Sustainability Report 20245The past year at Select Harvests has been one of growth 
of the business and consolidation of our sustainability 
program. We concentrated our efforts on streamlining 
essential data and projects, aiming to strengthen 
operational efficiency and sustainability across our 
business. This strategic approach not only enhanced our 
foundations but also enabled us to achieve significant 
milestones, including a remarkable 73% increase in 
harvest volumes—from 23,130 tonnes in 2022-23 to an 
impressive 40,047 tonnes in 2023-24. This growth 
highlights the success of our strategic focus and the 
progress we continue to make in scaling our operations.Safety remains a key priority for Select Harvests. This year,  
our total recordable injury frequency rate (TRIFR) increased 
slightly, demonstrating our continued commitment to 
improving the accuracy and transparency of our incident 
reporting. These efforts reflect our focus on maintaining a safe 
workplace and driving continuous improvement across all 
areas of safety performance.
Similarly, our environmental initiatives have remained integral 
to our strategy, advancing alongside the increased harvest 
volumes. A key achievement during the year was the 
continued success of our composting program, which 
reached new record volumes. This initiative supports soil 
productivity by improving soil health and reducing reliance 
on fertilisers, reaffirming our commitment to sustainable 
agricultural practices.
The significant growth in almond processing and increased 
harvesting did lead to a rise in total greenhouse gas 
emissions. However, we successfully mitigated this impact 
with a 25% reduction in emissions per processed tonne, 
reflecting our ability to balance higher production with 
sustainability. These outcomes underscore our commitment 
to managing growth responsibly while responding to 
increased operational demands.
Select Harvests made important strides in aligning our 
Sustainability Report data with the upcoming Australian 
Sustainability Reporting Standards. Concurrently, we 
maintained our adherence to the Global Reporting Initiative 
(GRI) 2021, the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol accounting 
standard, and the United Nations Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs). This positions us to meet the Australian 
Government’s mandatory sustainability-related disclosures 
commencing in 2025. Additionally, we pursued independent 
assurance for our greenhouse gas emissions and continued 
our management of the National Greenhouse and Energy 
Reporting Scheme for the second consecutive year.This year’s Sustainability Report outlines our performance 
against key targets and measures, while detailed financial 
outcomes are presented in the accompanying Annual Report 
2024. Together, they demonstrate a year of integrating growth 
with strategic consolidation, operational excellence, and 
commitment to sustainability.
Thank you for your continued interest and support. We 
welcome your feedback as we advance on our path of 
sustainable growth and success.

Select Harvests  Sustainability Report 2024
12During the 2023–24 reporting 
period, Select Harvests 
solidified its commitment to 
embedding sustainability at the 
core of our business strategy. 
This year allowed us to refine our practices and align with the 
United Nations definition of sustainability: ‘Development that 
meets the needs of the present without compromising the 
ability of future generations to meet their own needs.’

economic viability, ecological integrity and social equity. We 
are dedicated to creating value for our shareholders while 
addressing the triple bottom line.
To deliver on our vision and goal, we have framed our 
approach to sustainability around three pillars.
Our product
We are committed to supplying high-quality, safe, traceable 
plant-based food that is better for you, while contributing to a 
circular economy.
Our planet
We are committed to responsible stewardship of natural 
resources, reducing our emissions and building a business 
that is adapted to climate change and resilient to climate 
related shocks and stresses.      
Our people 
We are committed to providing a safe workplace, with a ‘zero 
harm’ goal, promoting a culture of wellbeing, diversity and 
inclusion, attracting high performing talent and contributing

The 2023–24 reporting period has been pivotal for Select 
Harvests, enabling us to align with our materiality review and 
prioritise key sustainability topics. It has reinforced our 
dedication to sustainable practices.
1. Food safety and quality
During this period, we reinforced our food safety protocols. 
By refining our traceability systems and enhancing testing 
procedures, we continue to ensure the highest quality and 
safety standards for our almond products.
2. Circular food production
By streamlining our approach, we have optimised our circular 
food production models. Our focus has been on minimising 
waste, maximising resource efficiency, and creating 
innovative by-products that support a more sustainable 
value chain.
3. Water efficiency 
We have taken this period to evaluate our water efficiency 
strategies.
4. Emissions and climate adaptation
Our focus has been on refining our approach to emissions 
reduction and climate resilience. We have strengthened our 
commitment to energy efficient practices and equipment and 
are actively exploring renewable energy sources to lower our 
environmental impact. Focus Areas
5. Workplace health and safety 
Our recent efforts have strengthened our ‘zero harm’ 
objective. We have improved safety training and risk 
management initiatives, while integrating our behaviour-
based safety (BBS) program and felt leadership.
6. Community engagement
Strengthening community ties has been a priority. We have 
used this time to review our involvement in local initiatives 
and how we can create economic opportunities, reinforcing 
our role as a responsible community partner. While this 
review is ongoing, we continued with a smaller community 
grants programme this year, focusing on delivering 
meaningful, long-term benefits to our communities.
Through these refined goals, Select Harvests is poised to 
lead in sustainable almond production, addressing the 
challenges and seizing the opportunities of 2024 and 
beyond.

eliminating waste, circulating 
products and materials, and 
regenerating natural resources 
to enhance the sustainability of 
our operations.

Relevant United Nations Sustainable  
Development Goals
 
 
 
 
Supporting the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals
Our initiatives align with the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs), particularly those focusing on 
sustainable consumption and production. The way food is 
produced significantly influences ecosystems and human 
health. Industrial food production relies heavily on fertilisers, 
pesticides, fossil fuels and fresh water – resources that are 
increasingly scarce. By transitioning to a circular economy 
model, we aim to reduce our dependence on synthetic 
inputs, cut emissions, and foster robust soil food webs.
Key opportunity areas
Harvest biomass
Our almond harvesting process is a prime example of 
circular food production. Over 60% of the almond fruit 
consists of hulls and shells – parts that are not consumed by 
humans and can pose a fire risk if improperly stored. Leaves 
and sticks are also collected during the harvesting process.
Instead of discarding these materials, we recover and 
repurpose them.
 xEnergy production:  Biomass collected during harvest is 
diverted to generate energy, providing a sustainable 
alternative to fossil fuels.
 xCompost:  Organic materials from our harvest contribute 
to nutrient-rich compost, promoting healthier soil and 
reducing reliance on chemical fertilisers. xGround hull and shell: A portion of our hulls and shells 
are sold in granular form, further integrating our 
operations into a circular system. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Environmental impact and growth opportunities
In line with 2024 standards, our composting initiative 
reduces emissions by efficiently diverting waste away from 
landfills and decreasing the need for imported fertilisers. This 
approach optimises efficient water use across our operations 
and contributes to significant environmental benefits.
Our circular compost model is paving the way for potential 
market expansion by opening new avenues for the growth 
and development of our compost products. By exploring 
these opportunities, we are poised to enhance our market 
presence and drive future progress.
These efforts demonstrate our commitment to advancing our 
sustainability objectives while simultaneously increasing 
value for our stakeholders, shareholders and the public.Product
