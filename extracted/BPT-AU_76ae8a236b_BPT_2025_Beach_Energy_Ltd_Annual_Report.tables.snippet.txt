9. Petroleum assets continued
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is determined as the higher of its value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. Value
in use is determined by estimating future cash flows based on reserves and in some cases resources after taking into account the risks
specific to the asset and discounting it to its present value using an appropriate discount rate. Fair value less costs of disposal also
considers value attributable to additional resource and exploration opportunities beyond reserves based on production plans as well as
"costs of disposal. If the carrying amount of an asset or CGU exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset or CGU is written down and an"
"impairment loss is recognised in the statement of profit or loss. For assets previously impaired, if the recoverable amount exceeds the"
"carrying amount and the indicators driving the increase in value are sustained for a period of time, the impairment loss is reversed, except"
"in relation to goodwill. The carrying amount of the asset or CGU is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only"
"to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation"
"or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised."
"Future cash flow information used for the recoverable amount calculations is based on the Group’s latest reserves, budget, five-year plan"
and economic life of field plans which includes information sourced and reviewed from operators of our non-operated interests.
The impact of the Safeguard Mechanism through either a carbon price or earning of SMCs on Beach facilities depending on emissions
relative to their baseline and the earning of ACCUs on Beach’s interest in the Moomba carbon capture and storage project have been
included as part of the recoverable amount calculations for each CGU where applicable. The actual and proposed investments required to
deliver the Group’s emissions target of a 35% emissions intensity reduction by 2030 (against 2018 levels) for Scope 1 emissions as well
as the ability to pass through any carbon costs incurred to customers are also included as part of the recoverable amount calculations for
each applicable CGU. Beach continues to monitor the uncertainty around climate change risks and will reassess its assumptions as the
energy transition progresses.
Current climate change legislation is also factored into the calculation and future uncertainty around climate change risks continue to be
monitored. These risks may include a proportion of a CGU’s reserves becoming incapable of extraction in an economically viable fashion;
"demand for the Group’s products decreasing, due to policy, regulatory (including carbon pricing mechanisms), legal, technological,"
market or societal responses to climate change and physical impacts related to acute risks resulting from increased severity of extreme
"weather events, and those related to chronic risks resulting from longer-term changes in climate patterns."
The value in use calculation for the Cooper Basin CGU includes a risked view of contingent resources that is expected to be converted to
reserves based on a history of production and resource conversions over a significant period of time with the development cost of these
resources included into the NPV calculation and in line with long term asset plans for the ongoing realisation of value from the asset.
This is assessed against a carrying value including additional exploration transfers to development aligned to these projected resource
conversions.
IMPAIRMENT AND IMPAIRMENT REVERSAL INDICATOR MODELLING
"In determining whether there is an indicator of impairment, in the absence of quoted market prices, estimates are made regarding the"
present value of future cash flows for each CGU. These estimates require significant management judgement and are subject to risk and
uncertainty and hence changes in economic conditions can also affect the assumptions used and the rates used to discount future cash
"flow estimates. In most cases, the present value of future cash flows is most sensitive to the assumptions outlined below."
"For impairment reversals, the present value of future cash flows are considered using lower oil price scenarios based on a Monte-Carlo"
"simulation of Reuters Mean and a 10% reduction in life of asset production, assuming production loss under a long-term oil-price"
constrained environment.
