We have advanced decarbonisation efforts, focusing on 
our highest-emitting operations in our aluminium value 
chain, being our Hillside Aluminium smelter and Worsley 
Alumina refinery.
We have invested in our Hermosa Project, currently the only 
advanced project in the United States capable of supplying two 
federally designated critical minerals, zinc and manganese.
We have also added copper to our portfolio with the acquisition 
of a 45% stake in Sierra Gorda. As the world moves towards 
electrification, copper will be increasingly in demand for power-
related infrastructure, including renewable energy.

At our Hermosa development, we are building the long-life Taylor 
zinc-lead-silver project and in Q4 we commenced sinking the main 
shaft and construction of the process plant. Hermosa has 
government support to help meet the United States’ critical 
minerals supply and, beyond Taylor, the Clark battery-grade 
manganese deposit is uniquely positioned due to its potential to 
supply the North American electric vehicle market. Exploration of 
the Peake prospect continues to return high-grade copper results 
and we are testing the potential for a continuous mineralised 
system extending back to Taylor.   
At Sierra Gorda, our cornerstone copper asset, there is potential to 
grow copper production through our brownfield expansion projects 
and, longer term, through the Catabela Northeast exploration 
project, where all 18 exploration holes have intersected significant 
copper mineralisation.
Exploration has been an important part of our strategy since day 
one. This year we invested US$35 million in our greenfield 
exploration opportunities in Australia, the US, Canada, Argentina 
and Namibia, as we work to discover our next generation of base 
metals mines.
Climate change is fundamentally reshaping our industry, driving the 
transition away from fossil fuels and increasing demand for 
minerals and metals we produce, while intensifying climate 
variability and extreme weather. We have published our second 
Climate Change Action Plan (CCAP) which sets out our approach to 
addressing the risks and opportunities that climate change 
presents. 
Our CCAP includes actions to reduce our operational emissions to 
mitigate transition risk and protect value, and to support emissions 
reduction across our value chains. Our target to halve our net 
operational emissions by FY35 from FY21 levels, and long-term 
goal of achieving net zero emissions across all scopes by 2050, 
remain unchanged.
While our FY25 operational emissions were 1.5 Mt CO 2-e lower than 
FY21, Mozal Aluminium’s increased reliance on coal-fired electricity 
due to drought conditions led to a 2% year-on-year increase in total 
operational emissions in FY25. The year-on-year increase in Scope 
2 emissions linked to Mozal Aluminium more than offset the 12% 
reduction in Worsley Alumina’s Scope 1 emissions during FY25, 
relative to FY21 levels, following the conversion of two boilers from 
coal to gas during the prior year.Our portfolio transformation has substantially lowered our Scope 3 
emissions since FY19, as it has reduced our exposure to emissions 
from the combustion of energy coal and the use of metallurgical 
coal. 
Strengthening climate resilience is essential to addressing the 
physical impacts of climate change on our operations, people, 
communities, and value chain. We have developed our first Climate 
Adaptation and Resilience Plan to help us reduce exposure to 
present-day climate hazards, and strengthen our ability to 
anticipate, absorb, respond and recover from physical climate 
change impacts. The Climate Adaptation and Resilience Plan also 
supports our focus on nature restoration, rehabilitation and 
conservation. 
As we enter the second decade of South32, much has changed in 
terms of what we produce but I believe one key theme remains – 
when done well, our business can help to improve people’s lives 
now and for generations to come. 
I would like to offer my sincere appreciation and thanks to our 
teams around the globe for their efforts over the past year, and 
indeed the past 10 years, as we have solidified our position as a 
diversified producer of the minerals and metals critical to the 
world’s energy transition.

Technology and innovation unlock value
Our FY25 commitments:
〉Deliver critical technology and innovation programs
Progress during FY25:
Technology and innovation are key enablers of our transition 
towards a low-carbon  future and to realising our objective of safer, 
cleaner and more productive operations. Our Group-wide approach 
to innovation, known as Innovate32, focuses on enabling the 
identification, investment and deployment of technologies across 
our business, and has three missions: Low Footprint, Next 
Generation Mine and Securing Future Resources. 
Within our Low Footprint Mission, we have a number of 
decarbonisation initiatives aimed at reducing emissions at Worsley 
Alumina. Recent efforts include supporting studies on long-
duration energy storage, calciner electrification, and energy and 
water efficiency technology. In addition, circularity technologies are 
being explored to reduce raw material consumption and 
associated Scope 3 emissions. 
As part of the Electric Mine Consortium, which concluded in 
September 2024 after a four-year collaboration, we conducted 
battery-electric vehicle (BEV) trials at Cannington. The aim was to 
reduce the use of diesel vehicles and equipment, and their 
associated emissions, especially in underground mines. We have 
applied the findings to  Hermosa , where we have signed contracts 
for the supply of production and ancillary BEV equipment. We are 
also a funding partner of the BluVein mine electrification project to 
develop an e-rail dynamic charging system for BEVs, with the aim 
of further optimising BEV operation.
We are collaborating with industry, government and research 
organisations on the Heavy Industry Low-Carbon Transition 
Cooperative Research Centre to accelerate technologies for heavy 
industry to transition to net zero. We continue to advance initiatives focused on life extension, 
tailings repurposing, and alternative closure strategies. In FY25, we 
assessed tailings repurposing opportunities across all our 
Australian operations and initiated an early-stage technology trial 
for waste rock sorting at our Cannington site. At Australia 
Manganese we are undertaking technology trials to increase 
recovery rates for the finer sand tails.
The Next Generation Mine Mission aims to reshape the way we 
mine to support better safety and productivity outcomes. I n the 
rapidly growing world of artificial intelligence , we have focused on 
areas that deliver the greatest value to our business and strategy. 
We are already seeing the benefits, with improved safety outcomes 
and tangible cash flow (currently A$20 million annually, with plans 
to realise A$50 million by the end of FY26).
New technology includes the Safety Companion tool being piloted 
at Hillside Aluminium. This virtual chatbot can provide our frontline 
workers and leaders with faster safety information and insights 
from our Global 360 risk and event management system, and 
related internal standards and guidelines. 
The Securing Future Resources Mission explores new methods to 
reduce uncertainty and support decisions in mineral exploration 
and evaluation. In FY25, we continued developing orebody 
knowledge and processing technologies to unlock value from 
complex copper orebodies.

CASE STUDY
Full steam ahead
We recognise that decarbonising energy-intensive industries, such as aluminium manufacturing, will require innovation and 
access to large-scale, reliable and affordable low-carbon energy sources.
In May 2025, it was announced Worsley Alumina has secured A$4.4 million in funding from the Australian Renewable Energy 
Agency (ARENA) to support the development of steam electrification pathways at its alumina refinery. The funding, which is 
being matched by South32, will allow Worsley Alumina to undertake a pre-feasibility study of four investment options for partial 
steam electrification. 
These include electric boilers, which generate steam directly using an electrode, and mechanical vapour recompression, which 
involves capturing low-pressure waste vapour from the refining process for recompression to create pressurised steam for 
reuse. 
The technologies have the potential to improve efficiency and reduce operating costs and emissions through the use of 
renewable electricity. They could also benefit other alumina refineries in the future.
