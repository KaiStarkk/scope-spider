,OUR CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVES,,,,
,Vicinity is committed to taking action to reduce our environmental footprint,,,,
,and manage the impact of climate change on our business. This approach,,,,
,"enables us to manage climate and environment related risks, strengthen",,,,
,"the resilience of our assets, support operational efficiencies, and identify",,,,
potential opportunities.,,,,,
Our climate and environment-related objectives are to:,,,,,
–  Deliver our Net Zero 2030 Target1,,,,,
,"–  Strengthen the resilience of our portfolio to adapt to a changing climate, and",,,,
,–  Deliver resource efficient operations and developments.,,,,
Our approach to managing climate change,,,,,
,"We acknowledge that climate change remains a significant global challenge and focus area for Vicinity, presenting risks and",,,,
,"opportunities across our business, communities and the broader economy, now and into the future.",,,,
,Our approach to managing the impact of climate change is informed by the recommendations of the Taskforce for Climate-related,,,,
,Financial Disclosures (TCFD). We are transitioning our approach to align to the Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards’,,,,
Australian Accounting Standards Board S2 – Climate disclosures (AASB).,,,,,
,"In FY25, we undertook a comprehensive assessment of climate-related risks and opportunities to build upon the risk assessment",,,,
,"completed in FY23. This assessment, aligned to Vicinity’s Enterprise Risk Management Policy and Procedures, identified",,,,
,"climate-related risks and opportunities that may be expected to have a material impact on Vicinity’s operations, financial",,,,
,performance or strategic direction across one or more of three climate scenarios and time horizons. The results of the risk,,,,
,assessment will be used to inform long-term strategic planning and enhance organisational resilience.,,,,
,1.  Target applies to Vicinity’s wholly-owned retail assets for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions (in common mall areas).,,,,

Our approach to managing climate-related risks and opportunities,
TCFD recommendation,Progress
Governance,Vicinity’s Board has oversight over climate-related risks and opportunities. The Board is supported
,by the:
,"–  Risk, Compliance and ESG Committee which oversees Vicinity’s climate-related and other ESG risks"
,and opportunities
,–  Audit Committee which oversees financial governance and risks and the integrity of financial
,"reporting and internal control processes, and"
,–  ELT which is responsible for Vicinity’s operations and delivering strategic objectives.
,"Vicinity has established a cross-functional Steering Committee, co-chaired by the Chief Financial"
,"Officer and Chief Legal, Risk & ESG Officer, responsible for overseeing our implementation of AASB S2."
Strategy,A key focus of Vicinity’s refreshed ESG roadmap is to enhance the climate resilience of our portfolio
,and reduce emissions associated with our operations and value chain.
,"Vicinity assesses our climate-related risks and opportunities regularly, most recently in FY25, and the"
,results inform long-term strategic planning and enhance organisational resilience.
,"In the risk assessment undertaken in FY25, Vicinity considered three climate scenarios to assess a"
,range of possible outcomes the business may face in future:
,– Low Emissions (RCP 2.6): 1.5˚C by 2100
,– Medium Emissions (RCP 4.5): 2.4-2.6˚C by 2100
,– High Emissions (RCP 8.5): >3˚C by 2100
,"Vicinity considered the impact of these scenarios over the near-term (2031), medium-term (2050) and"
,long-term (2070) time horizons in order to assess risks and opportunities over the projected lifespan of
,our asset portfolio. Further details of the material risk and opportunity themes identified through this
,process are outlined on page 42 of this Report.
,The impact of material risks and opportunities will be quantified in line with AASB S2 requirements and
,will inform a review of Vicinity’s climate strategy and governance approach.
Risk management,Climate change has been identified as a material risk in our Enterprise Risk Register – refer to page 48
,of this Report for more detail.
,"Vicinity applies a comprehensive and structured approach to identifying, assessing, prioritising and"
,"monitoring climate-related risks and opportunities across the portfolio, guided by our Enterprise Risk"
,Management Policy and Procedure.
Metrics and targets,"In 2019, Vicinity set a Net Zero 2030 Target, aligned to Australia’s commitments under the Paris"
,Agreement (under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change). The target covers
,Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon emissions from the common mall areas of Vicinity’s wholly-owned
,retail assets.
,More detail on our climate-related metrics and targets can be found on page 44 of this Report and in
,the 2025 Sustainability Performance Pack available on our website.
