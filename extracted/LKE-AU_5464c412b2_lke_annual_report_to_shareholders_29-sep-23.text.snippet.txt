Material Business Risks (continued)
KeyPersonnel
Informulating ourexploration programs, feasibility studies anddevelopment strategies, werelytoasignificant extent
upon theexperience andexpertise of our current management. Many of our keypersonnel are important toattaining
ourbusiness goals. One ormore ofthese keyemployees could leave their employment, and thismay adversely
affect ourability toconduct ourbusiness and, accordingly, affect ourfinancial performance and our share price.
Recruiting and retaining qualified personnel isimportant tooursuccess. The number ofpersons skilled inthe
exploration anddevelopment ofmining properties islimited andcompetition forsuch persons isstrong.
Resource Estimate Risk
Resource estimates areexpressions ofjudgement based onknowledge, experience and industry practice. These
estimates were appropriate when made butmay change significantly when new information becomes available.
There arerisks associated with such estimates. Resource estimates arenecessarily imprecise and depend tosome
extent oninterpretations, which may ultimately prove tobeinaccurate and require adjustment. Adjustments to
resource estimates could affect ourfuture plans and ultimately ourfinancial performance and value. Lithium price
fluctuations, aswell asincreased production costs orreduced throughput and/or recovery rates, may render
resources containing relatively lower grades uneconomic andmay materially affect resource estimations.
Environmental Risk
Our operations and activities aresubject totheenvironmental laws and regulations inthejurisdictions inwhich we
work. Aswith most exploration projects andmining operations, ouroperations andactivities areexpected tohave an
impact ontheenvironment, particularly ifadvanced exploration ormine development proceeds. We attempt to
conduct ouroperations and activities tothehighest standards ofenvironmental obligation, including compliance with
allenvironmental laws and regulations. Weareunable topredict theeffect ofadditional environmental laws and
regulations which may beadopted inthefuture, including whether any such laws orregulations would materially
increase ourcost ofdoing business oraffect ouroperations inany area. There can be no assurances that new
environmental laws, regulations orstricter enforcement policies, once implemented, willnotoblige ustoincur
significant expenses and undertake significant investments which could have amaterial adverse effect on our
business, financial condition and performance. Wearesubject toand compliant with allaspects ofenvironmental
regulation of our exploration and mining activities. Wearenotaware of any environmental lawthat isnotbeing
complied with.
Availability ofEquipment andContractors
Prior totheCOVID-19 pandemic and the2022 Russian invasion ofUkraine, appropriate goods, materials, supplies
and equipment, including drillrigs, was inshort supply. There was also high demand forcontractors providing other
services tothemining industry. The COVID-19 pandemic andthe2022 Russian invasion ofUkraine hasonly served
toexacerbate these issues. Consequently, there isariskthatwemay not be able tosource allthegoods, materials,
supplies, equipment andcontractors toperform required scopes ofwork tofulfil ourproposed activities. There isalso
ariskthat hired contractors may underperform orthat equipment may malfunction, either ofwhich may affect the
progress of our activities.

Material Business Risks (continued)
Climate Change Risk
Ouroperations andactivities aresubject tochanges tolocal orinternational compliance regulations related toclimate
change mitigation efforts, specific taxation orpenalties forcarbon emissions orenvironmental damage, and other
possible restraints onindustry that may further impact us and our profitability. While we willendeavour tomanage
these risks and limit any consequential impacts, there can be no guarantee that wewillnot be impacted bythese
occurrences. Climate change may also cause certain physical and environmental risks that wecannot predict,
including events such asincreased severity ofweather patterns, incidence ofextreme weather events and
longer-term physical risks such asshifting climate patterns. Allthese risks associated with climate change may
significantly change theindustry inwhich weoperate.
Macro-Economic Risks
Although theworld hasemerged from theCOVID-19 pandemic, global supply chains constraints, labour unavailability
and equipment shortages are still material risks toour operations. Supply chain constraints continue tobe
exacerbated because ofthe2022 Russian invasion ofUkraine.
Hyperinflationary pressures inArgentina forappropriately skilled labour and capital items arebeing seen across
many industries, including mining. Current domestic and international inflation isathistoric levels, resulting in
persisting elevated interest rates globally. These conditions could have material adverse impact toourcost ofdoing
business andfinancial performance.
Argentina Political Risk
Ouroperations canbeaffected bychanging political, regulatory andeconomic environments inthecountries inwhich
weoperate. Our exploration activities areentirely focused inArgentina, which willundergo elections in2023, the
result ofwhich could materially change thebusiness and financial climate ofthecountry. Itispossible that adverse
election results could materially impact ourability to, for example, maintain ourtenements, obtain and maintain
permits, negotiate with thegovernment acceptable fiscal terms tosupport any debt-financing, and/or exportation of
capital, any of which, ifrealised, could impact ourfinancial performance andability to develop ourprojects.
Argentina Financial Risks
Argentina, thejurisdiction inwhich wefocus ouroperations, maintains capital controls which have theeffect of
restricting our access toforeign exchange markets and repatriation ofprofits. These measures have been
implemented and maintained sporadically inArgentina formultiple decades with themost recent implementation
occurring in2019. These controls restrict ourability toconvert Argentinian Pesos intoU.S. Dollars orother currency
and may restrict ourability inthefuture toexport from Argentina profits weearn from ouroperations. Argentina
occasionally modifies itscapital controls frameworks, anychanges towhich, could have amaterial negative impact
on our future operations. Forexample, capital controls may impact ourability topayforimports intoArgentina inU.S.
Dollars orother hard currency. Additionally, ourlenders may restrict ourability touse aportion of debt funds for
in-country operations. Argentina also maintains arobust import program which restricts importation ofcertain
products wemay need from theinternational market. Compliance with Argentina’s import restrictions often results in
delays and theneed toattempt tosource needed products locally, either ofwhich could cause delays toour
operations.
