Our value chain includes the activities upstream and downstream of our business. We source materials and equipment from local  and international suppliers. This

customers from industries ranging from chemicals and fuels to conventional energy, lower carbon energy and mining and resourc es. In our assessment of climate -
related risks and opportunit ies, we consider how impacts to our value chain can affect different parts of our business. This helps us identify where clim ate-related 
risks may influence value creation through our operations, supply chains and customer needs, and where opportunities ex ist to strengthen our strategic position. This 
perspective is integrated in our scenario planning and enterprise risk processes, enabling more informed decision making. We also collect data from across our value 
chain to disclose our Scope 3 greenhouse gas  (GHG) emissions. We’re committed to improving the accuracy of these metrics as data and technology allow.
