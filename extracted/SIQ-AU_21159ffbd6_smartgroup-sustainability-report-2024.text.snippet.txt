We are committed to participating 
in the transition to a low-carbon 
future. In addition to addressing 
our own emissions, we strive 
to support our clients and their 
employees in understanding and 
reducing their carbon footprint. Our approach
Energy and emissions
Our operations consume energy and contribute 
to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, primarily 
through Scope 3 emissions related to our 
supply chain, which represent  84.9% of 
our total emissions. 
In 2022, we completed a full analysis for our 
Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, which established 
a baseline for measuring progress, identifying 
key focus areas and setting reduction targets. 
To address our operational emissions, we aim 
to increase the use of renewable energy and 
offset unavoidable emissions, beginning with 
those within our direct control. Our commitments 2024 Progress
All the sites we control will source 100% 
renewable energy by 2026.At the end of 2024, renewable energy accounted 
for 79% of total electricity used by all offices.
Our direct operations will be net zero 
by 2030.In 2024, we made measurable progress in 
reducing our direct operational emissions. 
Our Scope 1 emissions decreased 15% 
while Scope 2 emissions fell 43%.
Our business experienced significant growth 
in 2024, which impacted our Scope 3 
emissions profile.
We will implement annual reporting of 
Scope 3 emissions by 2026.In 2022, we completed the first Scope 3 
assessment to establish our emissions baseline. 
In 2024, we continued to improve our data-
collection process to improve the accuracy of our 
Scope 3 emissions and the quality of our reporting.
We will achieve a demonstrated reduction 
in Scope 3 emissions intensity by 2026.We are preparing an employee commuting 
and business-travel plan to help reduce our 
Scope 3 emissions. We are working with our 
supply chain to partner with suppliers who 
meet our sustainability goals and in turn help 
reduce our Scope 3 impact.

Our performance
Emissions reduction and renewable 
energy transition
In 2024, we made measurable progress in 
reducing our direct operational emissions. 
Our Scope 1 emissions decreased by 15% from 
114.99 tCO2e to 97.62 tCO2e, while Scope 2 
emissions from purchased electricity fell by 43% 
to 50.91 tCO2e, driven by our strategic shift 
toward renewable-electricity procurement. 
Our business experienced significant growth in 
2024, which impacted our Scope 3 emissions 
profile. The expansion of our business 
operations led to increased emissions in several 
areas: our procurement spending rose by 21%, 
business travel intensified with doubled flight 
distances. While these growth-related emissions 
increases reflect our business success, we are 
implementing targeted strategies to decouple 
our growth from environmental impact, including 
addressing employee and business travel, and 
optimising office technology and equipment. 
Because our energy agreements expire at 
different times, we have phased our transition 
to renewable energy. In 2023, three of our five 
main offices switched to renewable energy 
with Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide offices 
on fully renewable energy for the full year of 
2024. We are engaging with the landlords of 
the remaining two offices to encourage them 
to offer renewable energy options. At the end 
of 2024, renewable energy accounted for 79% 
of the total electricity used by all offices. You can read more about how we are 
mapping our supply chain to identify 
reduction opportunities on page 25.
A more sustainable fleet
While our overall novated leasing vehicles 
under management grew by 22% in 2024, 
we simultaneously accelerated our transition 
to electric vehicles, achieving a 36% increase 
in EV settlements. We also supported all 
our novated and fleet drivers with access to 
our Carbon Offset Program and education 
about sustainable vehicle choices and car 
usage. This demonstrates our commitment 
to sustainable mobility solutions even as we 
scale up our operations. You can read more 
about this on page 31. 
Addressing employee and business travel
Employee commuting and business travel 
are significant sources of emissions. We 
have embedded flexible working practices 
and continued investing in technology 
to enhance collaboration and encourage 
employees to minimise unnecessary travel. 
Additionally, we continued to offset emissions 
from all flights through our partnership with 
Greenfleet. In 2024, the funds from offsetting 
these flights supported the Wooden Hut project 
in Waka Waka and Barunggam Country in 
Queensland, aimed at revegetating more 
than 80 hectares of cleared land. We also 
entered an agreement with Qantas as a 
preferred travel partner, benefiting from their 
investments in projects outside the aviation 
sector through the purchase of carbon credits. 
Optimising office technology and equipment
Since 2023, we have replaced 480 laptops 
under the Lenovo CO2 Offset Service. By the 
end of 2026, we plan to replace all remaining 
laptops. We have also migrated part of our cloud 
services to Microsoft, which has an established 
Carbon Offset Program and a commitment to be 
carbon negative by 2030, with reporting aligned 
to GRI Standards.We have reduced the number of printers in 
our offices from 19 to 9 under a new agreement 
with Canon, which has lowered our printing 
volume. We have removed all single-use plastic 
serving ware from our offices, including those 
used in our kitchens and catering. These have 
been replaced with paper plates and reusable 
crockery and cutlery.

Our Sydney office has also improved 
how it processes and reports on e-waste, 
ensuring it complies with best practices. 
Since July 2023, we have collected and 
recycled 1,540kg of e-waste across multiple 
states, achieving a 95% recycling rate, 
which equates to a CO2 reduction of 6.6 MT.
Our Melbourne office building has now 
achieved a 5.5 star NABERS energy rating 
(without green power). This has improved 
from the previous 5 stars NABERS Energy 
Rating for the building for the period 
20 September 2020 to 19 September 2021. 
Enhancing our reporting approach
We have made progress to further understand 
our climate risks and are working towards 
alignment with the new mandatory climate 
reporting requirements outlined in the Australian 
Sustainability Reporting Standards (ASRS), 
developed by the Australian Accounting 
Standards Board (AASB). 
This year, we have continued to deliver against 
our disclosure roadmap and completed a 
qualitative scenario analysis risk assessment, 
which included an analysis of our climate-related 
risks and opportunities for two distinct climate 
scenarios (high and low emissions) over the 
short, medium and long term. 
Our team is working towards aligning all 
our reporting with AASB climate disclosure 
requirements (AASB S2) by 2026. You can 
read more about our climate disclosures on 
page 32 in our Annual Report.
