About:  The concept design integrates Ingenia’s 
brand colours into a vibrant canvas inspired 
by coastal landscapes, featuring warm earthy 
tones and black accents to honour First 
Nations heritage. Amongst other elements, 
meandering paths symbolise the life-giving 
rivers that intricately connect Ingenia’s 
communities and parks to their natural 
surroundings. It embodies sustainability, 
community, unity and harmony, resonating 
deeply with Ingenia’s core values.Cover image: Ingenia Holidays Byron Bay, NSW

3 SOCIAL GOVERNANCE APPENDICES ENVIRONMENT INTRODUCTIONOver FY24 a key initiative was progressing the 
preparation of our Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) 
with the launch of our Vision for Reconciliation 
during National Reconciliation Week (NRW) which 
will elevate our focus on our broader social impact.
Environment
We are continuing to make significant strides in our 
environmental initiatives. Our business inherently 
promotes lower carbon footprint living due to 
communal facilities in close proximity to residents, 
and the preference of our guests for domestic 
holidays in our holiday parks. 
In FY24, we continued construction on three 
communities in VIC, NSW, and QLD, targeting 
Green Star - Communities ratings, and we advanced 
our project of 261 Green Star Homes at Beveridge. 
We continued to invest in solar to support our 
emissions reduction targets and further work 
was done on defining our standards for new 
development which is the focus for growth and will 
be a key driver of future outcomes. We are currently 
reviewing our emissions pathway and climate risk 
disclosure to ensure they align with upcoming 
regulations and the future focus for the business.
Governance
In FY24, we made significant progress in our 
governance initiatives. We continued delivering 
actions under our Climate Strategy Improvement 
Roadmap, progressed our Modern Slavery response 
and disclosures, and advanced our Cyber Security 
Roadmap. These efforts ensure that we remain 
resilient and prepared to address the challenges 
and opportunities presented by climate change, 
modern slavery risks, and cybersecurity threats.
In closing, I am proud to be part of this incredible 
community and look forward to evolving our 
sustainability goals and ensuring they continue to 
be embedded in our broader business activities 
and plans. I look forward to collaboratively evolving 
and shaping Ingenia to deliver better outcomes and 
meet the needs of our customers and the broader 
community.
I encourage you to explore further the details of 
our work as presented in the rest of this Report and 
look forward to reporting further on our progress 
throughout the year. 
Sincerely,
 
 
John Carfi | CEO

INGENIA IS COMMITTED TO ACHIEVING 
ENERGY EFFICIENCIES AND REDUCING 
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM 
OUR BUILT COMMUNITIES AND BUSINESS 
OPERATIONS.
GHG emissions and risk management are the core of Ingenia’s 
climate change mitigation and adaptation strategy. We have 
undertaken a multi-pronged approach that includes increased 
adoption of alternative clean energy options, supporting 
energy efficiency measures in our built communities.
OUR REPORTED GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS 
ENCOMPASS THESE CATEGORIES: 
 SCOPE 1 EMISSIONS: 
These emissions primarily comprise of LPG and natural gas, which 
is used in barbecues and water heaters and is still in use in older 
homes and cabins. New developments are designed to be all electric.
SCOPE 2 EMISSIONS: 
This category includes emissions resulting from electricity 
consumption sourced from the grid. This electricity powers various 
aspects of our operations, including holiday parks, communal 
facilities within the Gardens, Lifestyle, and Rental communities.
RESIDENT EMISSIONS (SCOPE 3): 
Resident emissions encompass the GHG emissions produced from 
the electricity used in the homes of our residents across our Rental, 
Lifestyle and Gardens communities. 
In FY24, we continued to focus on reducing emissions 
and managing climate risks. Our approach to climate risk 
management is detailed in our Climate Disclosure Statement, 
issued in May 2023. This statement outlines our Climate 
Strategy, key risks, and opportunities across the business. 
Appendix A of this report includes details of energy use and 
emissions by portfolio and an update of our actions aligned 
to our Climate Strategy is outlined on page 88.
We are currently reviewing our Emissions Pathway and 
Climate Risk Disclosure to reflect the significant change in the 
Group’s asset base and business focus since our pathway was 
first established. This work will help us refine our strategies 
and ensure compliance with the latest standards as well as 
consider the Group’s Scope 3 emissions more widely. Emissions and
