Our engagement with local communities continues to be a key focus 
area. In FY24, we exceeded our target for community investment, 
contributing over $464,000 to a variety of community-led initiatives. 
A highlight of the year was our 
participation in the Mine Emergency 
Response Competition (MERC) for the 
first time. Our inaugural team of eight 
members underwent 13 days of intensive 
training, preparing for various emergency 
scenarios, from fire response to confined 
space rescue. Competing against 17 
other teams, our team’s remarkable 
dedication led to a second-place finish – 
an achievement that speaks to both the 
skills and readiness of our people and the 
supportive culture within our company.
Beyond physical health, we are equally 
committed to the mental wellbeing of 
our workforce. Our Workplace Wellness 
and Wellbeing Program at Duketon has 
played a vital role in providing fitness and 
rehabilitation support to our employees, 
reducing workplace injuries and promoting 
overall health. In FY24, we expanded our 
mental health initiatives by introducing 
new modules on Mental Health Awareness 
and Understanding Psychosocial Risks into 
the Regis Leadership Program. Nearly 100 
leaders participated in these programs, 
further reinforcing our commitment to 
building a mentally healthy workplace. 
Additionally, 14 of our employees 
volunteered to become Mental Health 
First Aid Officers, offering their time and 
expertise to support colleagues in need.Our engagement with local communities 
continues to be a key focus area. In FY24, 
we exceeded our target for community 
investment, contributing over $464,000 
to a variety of community-led initiatives. 
We also formalised a Working Together 
Agreement with the Mantjintjarra Ngalia 
Development Corporation, strengthening 
our relationships with key Indigenous 
stakeholders.
We were disappointed to receive the 
declaration against our McPhillamys 
project under Section 10 of the Aboriginal 
and Torres Strait Islander Heritage 
Protection Act 1984 (Cth) ( Section 10 
Declaration) in relation to a cultural 
heritage claim by an indigenous group 
that are not related to the local Aboriginal 
Land Council. The section 10 Declaration 
has rendered the project unviable under 
its current state and federal permitting 
approvals.  Regis has a good working 
relationship with the local Aboriginal Land 
Council and we look forward to continuing 
this relationship in the future. On the environmental front, our 
sustainability efforts delivered meaningful 
outcomes. We rehabilitated over 203 
hectares of disturbed land, exceeding 
our target of 200 hectares, and our water 
usage remained well within sustainable 
limits. Additionally, we reduced our Scope 
1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 10.3 
per cent, surpassing our target of a 4.9 per 
cent reduction. These achievements are 
central to our alignment with Australia's 
long-term commitment to achieving Net 
Zero by 2050, and we remain steadfast 
in our efforts to align with the Task Force 
on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD) guidelines.
Looking ahead, we will continue to build 
on the momentum we have generated in 
FY24. Our focus remains clear: maintaining 
safety excellence, fostering diversity 
and inclusion, enhancing environmental 
stewardship, and delivering value for our 
shareholders and stakeholders. With the 
unwavering dedication of our employees, 
we are well-positioned to continue driving 
positive change in the communities where 
we operate and beyond.
I want to extend my deepest thanks to our 
employees, stakeholders, and partners 
for their continued support throughout 
the year. Together, we are building a more 
sustainable and resilient future for all.

Materiality Process
The FY24 Sustainability Report highlights 
our sustainability performance, focusing 
on the most critical issues for our 
business and stakeholders. In FY23, 
our material topics were aligned with 
the GRI 2021 Standards, identifying our 
significant impacts on the economy, 
environment, and people, including 
their human rights. This comprehensive 
review considered all impacts across our 
value chain.
We assessed our industry context by 
reviewing material topics suggested and 
reported by peers, SASB standards for 
Metals and Mining, WGC Responsible 
Gold Mining principles, and the United 
Nations SDGs. Our analysis included 46 
external documents (from international 
standards, industry reports, and academic 
publications) and 18 internal documents 
(Regis’ strategy, policies, and procedures). 
An internal engagement survey further 
identified sustainability impacts and 
priorities recognised by our employees, 
including senior management.
We identified 55 impacts, assessed 
according to GRI methodology: "impacts can 
be actual or potential, negative or positive, 
short-term or long-term, intended or 
unintended, and reversible or irreversible." 
From these, 24 key impacts were deemed 
material.
As a result, our 24 key impacts were 
categorised into 14 material topics. 
Following the GRI guideline, Human Rights is 
now integrated across our value chain rather 
than being a standalone material topic. 
While identifying Material Topics according 
to the latest GRI Standards, we disclose 
performance using SASB indicators. Below 
is the list of material topics, aligned with the 
United Nations Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs).
In FY24, we reviewed and validated last 
year's topics with our executive leadership. 
As we anticipate regulatory changes with 
the new Australian Sustainability Reporting 
Standard, we plan to conduct a new 
materiality assessment next financial year.Material topics and their alignment with the Sustainable Development  
Goals (SDGs)

Climate Change Management
As a responsible gold miner, we recognise climate change as a key challenge. We 
acknowledge the climate change science and support the Paris Agreement Goals 
and are aligned with Australia's target of Net Zero by 2050. We are committed to 
identifying, assessing, actioning, and reporting our responses to climate change 
challenges and demonstrating year on year progression of our actions.
We are aligned to Australia's long-term commitment of achieving net zero emissions by 2050 
while acknowledging that our current life of mine plans do not extend that far out in time. 
However, we are mindful of setting realistic commitments for decarbonisation, and our intent 
is to ensure two key actions:
1. We are establishing and already progressing interim goals to reduce emissions by 2030. 
This Includes corresponding plans and performance metrics as guiding principles to 
articulate and monitor a clear commitment to progress and achievement of the set 
target. This includes aligning with the requirements of the Safeguard Mechanism. 
2. As we look to  investments that will prolong the lifespan of our reserves towards and 
ultimately past 2050, we aim to consider climate related risks, both physical (such as 
challenging weather patterns) and financial (such as carbon taxes) in our assessments. 
Examples of this to date include the commissioning and operation of a 9MW solar power 
farm at Garden Well and the commencement of construction of a 62MW renewable 
energy and battery storage project at Tropicana which includes four 6MW wind turbines, 
a 24MW solar farm and a 14MW battery storage system.Climate Governance
The Board of Directors guides and 
endorses the company's strategic course 
and goals, outlining a clear risk tolerance 
level. This encompasses climate-related 
risks and opportunities, for which the 
Board implements relevant policies. The 
Risk, Safety, Environment, and Community 
Committee (RSEC) bolsters the Board's 
supervision. Comprising non-executive 
directors, an Independent Chair, the RSEC 
Committee convenes at least four times 
annually to consider safety, environmental, 
and community-related risks.
On a managerial level, the CEO & MD  
holds responsibility for climate-related 
duties, with senior executives tasked 
with actions pertinent to their specific 
areas of accountability. The Board, RSEC 
Committee, and CEO supervise activities 
aimed at mitigating climate change risks, 
concurrently enhancing their understanding 
and overseeing the evaluation of climate-
related risks. Management embeds and 
integrates climate risks into wider business 
processes and procedures. Annual 
assessment and planning is conducted to 
highlight environmental risks and mitigation 
strategies.
