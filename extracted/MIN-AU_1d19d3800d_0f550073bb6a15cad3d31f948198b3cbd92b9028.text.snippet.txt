SUSTAINABILITY COMMITTEE CHAIR LETTER
“ON BEHALF OF THE  
BOARD AND SUSTAINABILITY  
COMMITTEE, I AM PLEASED 
TO PRESENT MINRES’  
SUSTAINABILITY  
REPORT FOR THE 2025 
FINANCIAL YEAR.”
It is a privilege to have joined MinRes and to serve as 
Chair of the Sustainability Committee. I recognise 
the challenges our business and the broader 
resources industry has faced over the past year and, 
with this in mind, I reaffirm our commitment to 
operating ethically and sustainably. 
As a proud Western Australian company, we recognise 
the unique landscapes and communities in which we 
operate. By communicating our performance 
transparently, we hold ourselves accountable while 
continually seeking ways to improve and reduce our 
impact on the environment and communities that host us.
This year, we realigned our approach to the way we do 
business with a refreshed set of values and a clear 
vision. Together, we’re focused on behaviours that 
grow our culture and shape positive relationships 
between our employees, shareholders, clients and 
partners. We’re committed to realising our vision of 
being a global leader in innovative resource project 
design, delivery and operation by embodying our 
values of care, unity, agility, integrity and courage. 
We continue to consider our people instrumental to 
our success. Despite a reduction in our overall 
workforce due to changing market conditions and 
sites entering care and maintenance, we continue to 
implement initiatives to support our people and 
improve health, wellbeing and safety.
This year, we were proud to open our Early Learning 
Centre next door to our head office, providing 
increased flexibility and support for employees. We 
further embedded our digital SafeDay tool to monitor 
and verify critical risks and controls in real time. Our 
on-site medical centre and Mind Matters team 
continue to provide ease, flexibility and support for 
our people. 
Operationally, one of our most significant achievements 
this year was the successful ramp-up of our Onslow 
Iron project which in August operated at an 
annualised run rate of 35Mtpa.Our connection to the communities where we operate 
is central to our business. This year, we invested 
$6 million in Western Australian communities in 
partnership with local organisations. We identified 
opportunities to further embed the organisations we 
partner with into our business, including by expanding 
the eligibility criteria of our NextGen Scholarship 
program to Clontarf Foundation and Shooting  
Stars alumni. 
We are particularly proud of our work with Traditional 
Owners. In FY25, we engaged 51 active Aboriginal 
suppliers, with a total spend of $73.5 million. We also 
formed two joint ventures with Traditional Owner 
entities to advance Aboriginal economic 
development, creating sustainable pathways for 
participation and growth.
Regarding our emissions reduction targets, while our 
gross emissions rose marginally in FY25 due to 
increased production, our underlying emissions 
intensity of production has decreased, through a 
combination of operational and efficiency factors. This 
year, we achieved a 23 per cent reduction in our 
Scope 1 and 2 mining emissions intensity, relative to 
our FY24 baseline. To further support our ambitions, we 
launched our Decarbonisation Fund which is designed 
to encourage and support low-carbon projects across 
our operations.
As we look ahead, we remain committed to working 
with integrity, transparency and innovation to ensure 
MinRes continues to deliver value for our people, 
communities and shareholders while protecting the 
environment.

Board approved sustainability performance targets have been set to address a number of our material 
sustainability topics and form the basis of our FY26 sustainability roadmap. To develop these targets, we 
considered our material sustainability opportunities, risks and global challenges with a key focus on continuous 
improvement and ensuring meaningful outcomes for all stakeholders. In FY26, MinRes will target the following:
ZERO
major social 
incidents.1
1  Major social incidents are incidents or events that have an actual major adverse community impact that affects long-term business continuity and 
triggers a ‘stop work order’, attracts significant or prolonged negative national media, or results in the revocation of the licence to operate.
2  High Impact Environmental Incidents (HIEI) are incidents that have an actual environmental consequence of high or major. These events have an  
 adverse impact on fauna/flora, habitat, soil, aquatic and land ecosystems, atmosphere or water resources lasting typically multiple years  
 (Level 4 and above).
3  Employee completion rate excludes casual employees, interns, non-executive directors, employees on workers compensation and employees on  
 long term leave, including parental leave.
4   Suppliers are screened by a third party platform against several social criteria to determine potential exposure to criminal activities and sanctions, 
money laundering, politically exposed persons, human rights abuses and modern slavery incidents.
5  Business units include Asset Management, Construction, Crushing and Processing, Mining Iron Ore, Mining Lithium, Mineral Resources Transport  
 and Project Services.
6  Site-based leader positions include supervisor, superintendent, manager and general manager. 
7  Site environment KPIs include the completion of scheduled environmental inspections and timely completion of compliance monitoring and reporting.
8  No direct or indirect impacts to biodiversity resulting in any species or ecological community being listed in a higher category of threat.

PATHWAY TO NET ZERO
MinRes’ roadmap and emission targets were most recently updated in FY24 following significant business growth 
and structural business changes.
• Long-term ambition: MinRes remains committed to its long-term goal of achieving net zero by 2050. 
•  Interim target: 45 per cent reduction in Scope 1 and 2 mining emissions intensity by FY35 relative to our FY24 
baseline, on a kgCO2e emitted per tonne of product shipped basis.
To achieve these ambitions, we aim to focus on driving measurable emissions reductions through a disciplined, 
incremental approach that balances technical viability, economic returns and organisational capability. In 
conjunction, we aim to design our new facilities and projects to have a lower emission profile or be ready to 
enable use of lower emissions technologies in the future as compared to a conventional business as usual design.
