1. In FY25 we saw a 51% reduction in our total 
recordable injuries as well as a 51% reduction in 
exposure hours compared to FY24. When coupled 
together as part of the TRIFR calculation, this only led 
to a modest overall reduction of 2% compared to 
FY24. Refer to page 30 for more information.Met our net zero

The achievements and progress  
made are a testament to IGO’s 
commitment to responsible mining, 
environmental stewardship, operational 
values, and prioritising meaningful 
engagement with our people and the 
communities we serve. 
IGO’s purpose is to Make a Difference 
and sustainability is at the core of this 
purpose. IGO’s Sustainability 
Framework has five pillars: valuing  
and protecting our people; partnering 
to create shared value; transitioning  
to a low carbon future; driving 
environmental stewardship and 
operating with integrity. Underpinning 
each of these pillars is IGO’s belief in  
a clean energy future through the 
discovery, development and delivery  
of battery minerals.
At IGO, safety is a foundational value 
that shapes our culture and guides 
every decision. Our safety record in 
FY25 delivered a small reduction in 
TRIFR and other reported statistics. 
However, this masks the positive 
change that has commenced.  
Down from 39 recordable injuries in 
FY24, we recorded 19 in FY25 – noting 
that exposure hours also reduced.  
In Q1 we recorded 8 injuries, in Q2  
there were 5, then 4 in Q3 and 2 in Q4. The injury severity rate dropped by 81% 
between the first and second halves  
of the year. We are making positive 
progress in improving our safety 
performance and we recognise that 
there is still much more to do as we 
focus on our safety culture through 
leadership, robust systems, engaged 
behaviours and safe environments.  
This year, we advanced several key 
initiatives, including our Taking  
Control of My Safety Program and 
strengthened safety leadership  
through Visual Safety Leadership 
Interactions (VSLIs).
In addition to safety, we are also 
committed to improving employee 
health and wellbeing. Our I-GO Well 
initiative has made significant strides  
in supporting our people through 
musculoskeletal injury prevention and 
promoting psychosocial safety  
across our workplaces. Our people  
are integral to all we do and all we want 
to achieve. IGO is an equal opportunity 
employer and pursues workplace 
diversity where appropriate. 
Leadership is foundational to the 
success of IGO and this year we 
developed a Leadership Development 
Program. This program is designed  
to strengthen leadership capability across the organisation, equipping 
participants to lead with clarity, 
empathy and purpose. It plays a vital 
role in our commitment to developing 
leaders who can inspire their teams, 
drive strategic priorities and confidently 
lead through change.
In July 2025, we proudly marked  
the completion of our first Innovate 
Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP).  
Our RAP delivered meaningful 
outcomes such as the formation of  
the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander 
Peoples Advisory Group and a  
Cultural Learning Strategy to deepen 
understanding and respect across IGO. 
Building on this foundation, we are 
developing a new RAP with an 
emphasis on relationships, respect  
and opportunity. 
We believe that responsible mine 
closure is a balance of economic, 
environmental, and social 
considerations. As we mature planning 
for and execution of mine closure 
planning for our operating sites, 
collaboration with Traditional Owners 
has become even more vital. We will 
work side-by-side to develop plans  
that are culturally respectful and  
reflect shared aspirations. Chair and CEO's Message
As we reflect on FY25, we are proud  
to present IGO’s Sustainability Report. 
Our work with the Ballardong and 
Ngadju people provides powerful 
examples of this genuine partnership  
in action. At our Forrestania Operation, 
we have been developing local 
provenance seed banks to restore 
disturbed areas with a diversity of 
native plants. At our Nova Operation, 
we are progressing detailed closure 
planning and engaging with the Ngadju 
people to identify opportunities they 
see for existing infrastructure and to 
support the rehabilitation of our broad 
exploration footprint. Our environmental 
activities exemplify our approach to 
long-term stewardship, shared value 
and leaving a lasting legacy.
We achieved a major milestone by 
reaching net zero Scope 1 and  
Scope 2 emissions at our Nova 
Operation in FY25 through 
decarbonisation activities and the 
voluntary cancellation of ACCUs.  
This reflects years of dedication to 
decarbonisation and innovation. 
Meanwhile, we are preparing for the 
upcoming AASB S2 Standard -  
Climate-related Disclosures  through  
an internal climate-reporting program 
to further embed climate  
considerations into our business.We thank shareholders for their  
support and belief in our Purpose. 
Sustainability at IGO is embedded in 
who we are, how we operate, and the 
legacy we aim to leave. As part of our 
commitment and contribution to a  
clean energy future, we will continue  
to integrate principles of care, 
responsibility and resilience into  
all that we do.
