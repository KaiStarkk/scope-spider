Our engagement with local communities continues to be a key focus 
area. In FY24, we exceeded our target for community investment, 
contributing over $464,000 to a variety of community-led initiatives. 
A highlight of the year was our 
participation in the Mine Emergency 
Response Competition (MERC) for the 
first time. Our inaugural team of eight 
members underwent 13 days of intensive 
training, preparing for various emergency 
scenarios, from fire response to confined 
space rescue. Competing against 17 
other teams, our team’s remarkable 
dedication led to a second-place finish – 
an achievement that speaks to both the 
skills and readiness of our people and the 
supportive culture within our company.
Beyond physical health, we are equally 
committed to the mental wellbeing of 
our workforce. Our Workplace Wellness 
and Wellbeing Program at Duketon has 
played a vital role in providing fitness and 
rehabilitation support to our employees, 
reducing workplace injuries and promoting 
overall health. In FY24, we expanded our 
mental health initiatives by introducing 
new modules on Mental Health Awareness 
and Understanding Psychosocial Risks into 
the Regis Leadership Program. Nearly 100 
leaders participated in these programs, 
further reinforcing our commitment to 
building a mentally healthy workplace. 
Additionally, 14 of our employees 
volunteered to become Mental Health 
First Aid Officers, offering their time and 
expertise to support colleagues in need.Our engagement with local communities 
continues to be a key focus area. In FY24, 
we exceeded our target for community 
investment, contributing over $464,000 
to a variety of community-led initiatives. 
We also formalised a Working Together 
Agreement with the Mantjintjarra Ngalia 
Development Corporation, strengthening 
our relationships with key Indigenous 
stakeholders.
We were disappointed to receive the 
declaration against our McPhillamys 
project under Section 10 of the Aboriginal 
and Torres Strait Islander Heritage 
Protection Act 1984 (Cth) ( Section 10 
Declaration) in relation to a cultural 
heritage claim by an indigenous group 
that are not related to the local Aboriginal 
Land Council. The section 10 Declaration 
has rendered the project unviable under 
its current state and federal permitting 
approvals.  Regis has a good working 
relationship with the local Aboriginal Land 
Council and we look forward to continuing 
this relationship in the future. On the environmental front, our 
sustainability efforts delivered meaningful 
outcomes. We rehabilitated over 203 
hectares of disturbed land, exceeding 
our target of 200 hectares, and our water 
usage remained well within sustainable 
limits. Additionally, we reduced our Scope 
1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by 10.3 
per cent, surpassing our target of a 4.9 per 
cent reduction. These achievements are 
central to our alignment with Australia's 
long-term commitment to achieving Net 
Zero by 2050, and we remain steadfast 
in our efforts to align with the Task Force 
on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD) guidelines.
Looking ahead, we will continue to build 
on the momentum we have generated in 
FY24. Our focus remains clear: maintaining 
safety excellence, fostering diversity 
and inclusion, enhancing environmental 
stewardship, and delivering value for our 
shareholders and stakeholders. With the 
unwavering dedication of our employees, 
we are well-positioned to continue driving 
positive change in the communities where 
we operate and beyond.
I want to extend my deepest thanks to our 
employees, stakeholders, and partners 
for their continued support throughout 
the year. Together, we are building a more 
sustainable and resilient future for all.

Energy and Emissions
We continue to report on our energy usage and emissions through the Australian 
Government's National Pollutant Inventory (NPI) and the Australian Clean Energy 
Regulator's National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting scheme (NGER). Our Scope 
1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions are calculated in accordance with the 
methodology defined by NGER, with second party review and audit of the data.
Energy use
Throughout the year, our operations utilised 
2,999 terajoules of energy, primarily derived 
from the combustion of diesel fuel linked to 
our mining activities in Western Australia. 
This signifies a 9% reduction in energy 
consumption compared to the previous 
year, primarily attributed a drop off in mining 
activity and processing as we move towards 
care and maintenance at the Duketon North 
operation.With total ore processed amounting to 8.2 
million tonnes for the year, we achieved an 
energy intensity metric of 0.368 gigajoules 
per tonne of ore processed. This led to a 
2% decrease in energy intensity from 
the previous year. The slight uptick in 
electricity sourced from the grid was a 
result of the expansion of our corporate 
offices in Blayney. In FY24 we consumed 
14.33 terajoules of energy from renewable 
sources. Annual Energy Consumption

Note: GHG emissions data only covers our 
Duketon operations.Greenhouse gas emissions 
This year, we generated 206 kilotons of 
carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions resulting from direct and 
indirect sources. This is a 10% reduction 
from last year's emissions total which is 
due to less fuel usage supported by lower 
haulage rates and dig fleet numbers. Our 
emissions intensity of 0.025 kilograms of 
carbon dioxide per tonnes of ore processed 
was also less than last year. 
In FY24, we engaged independent 
environmental accounting firm, Greenbase, 
to complete the NGER and NPI reports. It 
is our intention to progress our emissions 
reporting to include a third-party review and 
audit in future years where required.During FY24, under the existing Safeguard 
Mechanism Rules, we engaged independent 
third-party consultants who provided 
second party review and audit of our GHG 
emissions in relation to historical production 
and electricity generation. This assessment 
was aimed at ensuring an accurate 
understanding of our carbon footprint, 
particularly our emissions intensity, in 
line with regulatory requirements and 
environmental best practices. As part 
of this process, a separate independent 
third party was commissioned to provide 
reasonable assurance over our application 
for an emissions-intensity determination. 
Following this assurance process, the Clean 
Energy Regulator approved our application, 
including the calculated emission-intensity 
factors. These approved factors are now 
incorporated into our Safeguard Mechanism 
estimations, which are used to track and 
report our progress in managing and 
mitigating GHG emissions in compliance 
with Australia’s climate policy framework.

Solar farm at Garden Well
In FY24 our current power provider, 
Pacific Energy Ltd, commissioned and 
began operating the 9MW solar farm at 
Garden Well. The solar farm supplements 
diesel power at the Garden Well Power 
Station. Its introduction reduced the diesel 
consumption during daylight hours and 
provided a more competitive price for 
power generation. This lowered our carbon 
footprint and will contribute to the Federal 
Government’s 43% CO2e reduction target by 
2030.
During the year, Regis continued to explore 
opportunities for further renewable energy 
projects.
(6) The audit was completed to acquire emission intensity factors and move to a production facility adjusted safeguard baseline for the Duketon South operations. 
The audit outcome was accepted by the CER, and we can now use the facility specific emissions intensity factors, rather than default factors. 
The solar farm at Garden Well 
generated 3,979,467kWh of 
clean electricity in FY24. Without 
the solar plant, we would 
have consumed an additional 
972,689L of diesel and emitted 
an extra 2,636 tCO2e emissions 
by the diesel power station. The Safeguard Mechanism was 
introduced by the Australian 
Government in 2016 to decarbonise 
the operations of Australia’s biggest 
emitting companies. Industrial 
facilities with Scope 1 emissions 
greater than 100,000 tonnes per year 
are subject to baselines that manage 
the annual emissions they can emit. If 
a facility exceeds their baseline their 
options include surrendering carbon 
offsets, incurring financial penalties 
or other remedies. 
In 2023, a proposed adjustment was 
introduced with a new emissions 
benchmark of a 4.9% annual 
reduction. More information on the 
results of our review can be found 
within our FY23 Sustainability Report.Decarbonisation strategy 
As part of our ongoing decarbonisation 
strategy, we continue to assess emissions 
reduction solutions to reduce our emissions 
by FY30 to a point that ensures the 
site complies with the new Safeguard 
Mechanism baseline. During the year, we 
conducted a series of activities which 
included the following: 
Estimation of GHG emissions as part of 
LoM planning 
External audit by KPMG of Duketon's 
annual NGER reports from 2018/19 to 
2022/23(6)  
Annual NGER and NPI reports 
completed by Greenbase
Annual update of Decarbonisation 
Strategy
Continued review of progress against 
the Safeguard Mechanism
