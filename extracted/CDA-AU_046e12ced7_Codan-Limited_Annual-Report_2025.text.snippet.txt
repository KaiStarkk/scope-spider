Minelab delivered revenue of $254.8 million, up 
16% on the prior year . Segment profit rose 26% 
to $98.2 million, with margins improving to 39%, 
supported by favourable product mix and scale 
benefits. Minelab Africa delivered strong growth, 
with revenue up 64% year-on-year to approximately 
$115 million, supported by broad-based demand 
across the region. Minelab’s Rest of World business 
maintained revenues versus prior corresponding 
period - a solid outcome given ongoing consumer 
headwinds. This performance reflects the strength 
of our brand, an expanding distribution network, 
and continued investment in retail and e-commerce 
growth. While Countermine sales moderated due to 
reduced U.S. humanitarian aid, we are repositioning 
this business toward military applications where 
demand is growing. Incremental growth in FY26 is 
expected to be supported by four product releases, 
including the Gold Monster 2000.
Codan’s approach to acquisitions is accordingly 
measured and strategic: we target businesses that 
can sustain or improve our margins, offer synergies 
in technology or market access, and provide more 
recurring or long-term program revenue. In FY25, 
we incurred approximately $5 million of non-
recurring due diligence costs, including for Kägwerks 
and other opportunities that were evaluated but not 
pursued because they did not meet our acquisition 
criteria. This disciplined approach to capital 
allocation protects shareholder value and ensures 
that any acquisition we undertake strengthens 
Codan for the long term. In parallel with M&A, 
we invested in internal systems and processes to 
support our expanded group. Following the series of 
acquisitions in recent years (including DTC, Zetron, 
Broadcast Wireless Systems, Zetron UK (formerly 
Eagle NewCo), Geoconex, Wave Central, and now 
Kägwerks), a major focus has been on integrating 
these entities into one Codan, with unified core 
systems that will enable future scalability. During 
the year we allocated resources to IT infrastructure, 
enterprise resource planning (ERP) enhancements, 
and process improvements to streamline operations 
across geographies. These investments, while 
impacting short-term overhead, are laying a strong 
foundation for efficient growth and agility as we scale 
to a larger , more global company.Over the past year , Codan has continued to embed 
its Environment, Social, and Governance (ESG) 
Framework across the organisation, reinforcing 
our commitment to sustainable and responsible 
growth. We made meaningful progress on our 
climate goals, including preparation for Australia’s 
mandatory climate-related disclosure regime 
commencing in FY26. In partnership with Adelaide-
based consultancy 2XE, we implemented emissions 
tracking software to improve the accuracy and 
scalability of our carbon reporting. Codan was 
also proud to receive a Green Industries SA AIM 
Grant to assist with our efforts in circular economy 
innovation and carbon footprint reduction. Under 
the Social pillar , we deepened our community 
investment through long-term partnerships with 
Yalari and expanded support for STEM education 
via scholarships and mentoring programs for 
under-represented groups. We also strengthened 
our engagement in the regions where we operate, 
becoming members of the Committee for Adelaide 
and the American Chamber of Commerce in 
Australia. These initiatives reflect our ongoing 
commitment to creating a more inclusive, resilient 
business and delivering long-term value for 
all stakeholders.
Looking ahead, Codan enters the 2026 financial 
year with confidence and optimism, albeit clear-
eyed about the broader economic and geopolitical 
context. In Communications, we normally target 
10–15% annual revenue growth. For FY26, with 
approximately $155 million already secured in 
the order book, increased defence spending, 
growth in unmanned systems, and the first full-year 
contribution from Kägwerks, we are positioned 
to deliver 15–20% growth. We also anticipate 
further operating leverage improvements as we 
scale, progressing toward our goal to achieve 
30% Communications segment profit margin by 
the end of FY27 . Minelab also has an exciting year 
ahead, with the launch of new detectors expected 
to drive incremental growth opportunities across 
key markets.CEO’S REPORT

ENVIRONMENT, SOCIAL & GOVERNANCE REPORT
CEO’s Statement
Codan’s purpose is to create long-term value through 
innovation, reliability, and responsible business 
practices. As a global technology company, we 
remain committed to operating in a way that drives 
commercial success and delivers positive outcomes 
for our people, communities, and the planet. This 
ESG Report outlines the progress we have made 
across key areas in FY25, as we continue to integrate 
“sustainability” into every aspect of our operations.
This year we expanded our community 
engagement, investing in programs that promote 
education, inclusion, and opportunity. Most 
notably, our support of Yalari is enabling Indigenous 
students to access quality education and life-
changing experiences. We continue to inspire the 
next generation of STEM leaders through ongoing 
support of industry based and academic programs. 
Codan also became a member of the Committee for 
Adelaide and the American Chamber of Commerce 
in Australia, strengthening our ties with the 
communities and markets in which we operate.
We took meaningful steps to prepare for the 
mandatory climate-related disclosures that 
will commence in FY26 under the Australian 
Sustainability Reporting Standards. Our focus has 
been on establishing a robust system to capture 
data across Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions. This 
provides the foundation for setting credible targets, 
as those must be based on reliable and consistent 
information. We are well advanced in this work, 
which represents a critical step towards setting and 
tracking future targets. We partnered with Adelaide-based environmental 
consultancy 2XE to enhance our emissions tracking 
and scenario planning capabilities, including 
deployment of their carbon management software 
which will scale with our operations globally. 
A highlight of FY25 was being awarded the Green 
Industries South Australia AIM Grant, which supports 
our efforts to embed circular economy principles into 
our product development and value chain strategy.
Building resilience and securing long-term success 
in a changing world requires a clear focus on climate, 
governance, and social responsibility. This year’s 
ESG Report reflects Codan’s progress and growing 
maturity in these areas. We remain committed to 
strengthening our foundations and preparing for the 
opportunities and challenges ahead.
Sincerely,
Alf Ianniello

ENVIRONMENTClimate Change
Codan remains committed to doing its part 
to mitigate climate change and adapt to a 
changing world.
Codan supports the goals of the Paris Agreement to 
limit the global temperature rise this century to well 
below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and strive to 
limit this to 1.5°C. These goals require a collective 
effort across all sectors and economies to rapidly 
reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This calls for a 
diligent approach to understand the company’s 
emissions profile and the actions required to reduce 
emissions. 
Codan is also building its understanding of the 
climate-related risks and opportunities that may 
impact Codan’s business model and value chain in 
the short, medium and long term. This assessment 
will help inform Codan’s strategic decision-making 
and planning and reinforce Codan’s resilience to 
the developments and uncertainties of a rapidly 
changing world. 
Codan’s Approach to Climate-Related 
Disclosures 
Codan has provided voluntary climate-related 
disclosures in alignment with the Taskforce for 
Climate Related Financial Disclosures ( TCFD ) 
Recommendations since FY23 and followed a TCFD 
Roadmap to progressively mature its approach.  
In FY25, Codan has evolved this reporting approach 
towards the more detailed requirements of the 
Australian Sustainability Reporting Standard for 
climate-related disclosures ( AASB S2 ).Codan plans to publish its first mandatory report 
under AASB S2 for FY26. In preparation for this 
new reporting regime, in FY25 Codan has taken the 
following steps:
• Completed a gap analysis for Codan’s readiness to 
report under AASB S2.
• Completed a climate-related risks and 
opportunities assessment and prepared a 
provisional list for further analysis.
• Reviewed Codan’s overall risk management 
processes and identified options for integrating 
processes for climate-related risks and 
opportunities.
• Established new processes for the collection of 
Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions data. 
• Initiated a project to analyse embodied carbon 
across Codan’s product range and identify 
opportunities to decarbonise Codan’s value chain 
through circular economy initiatives. 
• Continued to engage with key suppliers on 
climate adaptation and decarbonisation.
More information about these steps is provided in 
the sections below on: Governance, Strategy, Risk 
management and Emissions Profile.
During FY26, Codan will assess its climate resilience 
using climate scenario analysis and investigate the 
financial effects of relevant climate-related risks and 
opportunities. In addition Codan will continue to 
improve its data collection processes for greenhouse 
gas emissions. 
These steps will enable Codan to determine the 
materiality of climate-related risks and opportunities, 
inform Codan’s strategic and risk management 
response and assist in the development of a 
transition plan. 
Governance
Codan is committed to responsible and effective 
governance, which promotes the integrity and 
efficiency of the business and maximises shareholder 
value. In accordance with the Governance pillar 
of Codan’s ESG Framework, we aim to uphold a 
strong governance program including the utilisation 
of a Sustainability Council. Codan is dedicated 
to identifying and managing risks, issues and 
opportunities that are important to our business  
and stakeholders, which will assist in creating  
long term value. ESG REPORT
Board Oversight
The Codan Board has overall responsibility for 
the oversight of group risks and opportunities, 
including sustainability and climate related issues. 
The Audit and Risk Committee ( ARC ) oversees the 
development and monitoring of risk management 
policies implemented by management. The Board 
has delegated authority to the ARC in respect of 
sustainability and climate-related risks. The ARC 
reports regularly to the Board on its activities.
The ARC assists the Board in its oversight of financial 
and non-financial risks including climate-related risks 
and other ESG factors. This responsibility is explicitly 
described in the ARC Charter . The ARC Charter also 
allocates responsibility to the ARC for reviewing 
and recommending to the Board any reporting 
to shareholders on matters considered material, 
including reporting on any material information 
about climate-related risks.
Quarterly updates are provided to the Board by the 
General Counsel and Joint Company Secretary on 
all ESG initiatives, with a focus on climate related 
actions. In FY25, these updates have also kept the 
Board informed of Codan’s progress to prepare  
for compliance with the new requirement of the 
AASB S2. 
In addition to quarterly updates, Codan’s board 
management software has a specific channel to keep 
the Board informed of ESG and climate-related news 
on an ongoing basis. Management
Management is responsible for the implementation 
of Codan’s group risk management policies and 
procedures, including the implementation of 
Codan’s ESG Framework and the recommendations 
of the Sustainability Council.
In accordance with its Terms of Reference, the 
Sustainability Council is expressly tasked with 
considering the physical risks of climate change 
for Codan’s businesses, as well as the risks and 
opportunities that may be material for Codan as 
the world transitions to a low carbon economy. 
Additionally, the Sustainability Council is committed 
to achieving a high standard of environmental 
performance and has oversight of the policies and 
operational controls of environmental, health and 
safety, and social risks. 
Members of the Sustainability Council include 
Codan’s General Counsel and Joint Company 
Secretary and its Chief Human Resources Officer 
(CHRO ). The council is appropriately represented 
from all parts of the global business, with members 
from Codan’s facilities and supply chain function 
along with management representatives from DTC, 
Zetron and Minelab.
As outlined in its Terms of Reference, the 
Sustainability Council is on track to conduct four 
formal meetings each year and the meetings for 
FY25 were all well attended.
The CHRO is the executive representative on the 
Sustainability Council. The CHRO reports any 
material ESG and climate related issues to the 
executive team. The General Counsel is the chair of 
the Sustainability Council and reports directly to the 
CEO and CFO on all ESG matters.
