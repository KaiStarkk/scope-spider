Caring for our Planet
22 www.LynasRareEarths.comIn compliance with the Australian National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act (NGER), Lynas reports Scope 
1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions associated with the Mt Weld and Kalgoorlie sites in Western Australia to the Clean 
Energy Regulator.
Lynas Rare Earths’ GHG methodology is available at: https://lynasrareearths.com/sustainability/
our-commitment-to-esg/
7.2 Impact of GHG emissions
Lynas conducted Life Cycle Assessments for our products and calculated an emission average of 30kg CO 2-eq per 
kg of REO from our internal LCA on year 2019 basis.
A Life Cycle Assessment for permanent magnet motors used in water pumps has also been conducted in conjunction 
with value chain partners. This assessed the manufacturing data from two electric motor pumps, one an induction 
motor using copper coil for an electromagnet, and the second a permanent magnet motor using neodymium-iron- 
boron magnets. The manufacturing of the pump from rare earth permanent magnets was shown to have 50% lower 
carbon dioxide equivalent emissions and over 10 years, will produce 75% lower carbon dioxide equivalent emissions. In 
addition, the permanent magnet motor pump was 50% lighter than the induction motor pump.
7.3 Land use and ecological sensitivity
Lynas’ key biodiversity goals are to:
 •Protect the environments in which we operate;
 •Avoid adverse effects on biodiversity through application of the mitigation hierarchy; and
 •Achieve zero significant environmental incidents.7.1.1 Greenhouse gas emissions
Our performance
Lynas monitors and reports on total Scope 1 and Scope 
2 GHG emissions in line with the GHG Protocol and 
Australia’s National Greenhouse Energy Reporting 
(NGER). Our Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions data  
is available in Section 9 Performance Data Tables.
Scope 3 emissions are divided into different categories 
and Appendix 4 provides an overview of the evaluation 
status for each category.Lynas Malaysia energy use
The Lynas Malaysia plant primarily uses natural gas and grid electricity. Some diesel is consumed in machines and 
processes. The 0.75MW rooftop solar array was commissioned and began operating in FY25.
OUR FY25  
ACHIEVEMENT
Mt Weld hybrid  
power station gas  
plant constructed and 
commissioned and solar 
farm constructed OUR FY26  
GOAL
Mt Weld – 65MW  
hybrid power station  
(solar, wind, battery,  
gas) commissioned  
and fully operational
