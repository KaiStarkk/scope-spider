Letter from the Chair and  
Managing Director &  
Chief Executive Officer
Our focus remains on building long-term 
resilience by addressing the evolving risks and 
opportunities that are material to our business.
Macmahon has embraced the introduction of  
the Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards 
(ASRS), and FY25 has been a foundational year 
preparing for the new mandatory requirements  
of AASB S2 Climate-related Disclosures  
(AASB S2), which take effect from FY26. 
To support this transition, we commissioned 
an external third-party review to assess our 
readiness for the ASRS. This review provided 
an independent assessment of the robustness 
of our current systems and identified key areas 
to support future compliance and assurance 
readiness as our corporate structure evolves. 
As such, this year’s Report is positioned as a 
voluntary transitional disclosure to the ASRS, 
outlining the voluntary actions we have taken 
to strengthen our reporting systems, review On behalf of the Board, I'm pleased to provide you with Macmahon's FY25 
Sustainability Report, which outlines our ongoing efforts to embed sustainability 
into our strategy, planning, operations and culture. 
emissions boundaries, and enhance internal 
capabilities and oversight. These efforts not only 
ensure that our future reporting is credible and 
aligned with emerging standards but also create 
a more resilient and value-driven sustainability 
reporting culture that supports better decision-
making across the business.
This year, we continued our efforts to mature 
our critical risk standards, support employee 
mental health and delivered our annual Respect@
Macmahon roadmap to maintain a safe, respectful 
and inclusive culture. We also continued the 
roll out of 'The Macmahon Winning Way', a 
bespoke leadership program to enhance effective 
leadership and promote psychosocially safe 
work environments. Since the program’s launch 
in FY24, over 350 leaders have completed this 
training. During the year, we rolled out Winning 
Way Pit Stops – one-day learning sessions to 
support content embedment and the continuous 
development of our leaders.

Reporting Scope and Boundaries
Macmahon assesses its obligations under the 
National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 
(Cth) on an annual basis. This includes determining 
whether the Group exceeds any reporting thresholds 
for Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, energy 
consumption, or energy production within Australia, 
based on operational control. Macmahon did not 
exceed any reporting thresholds for mandatory 
reporting in FY25.
Macmahon has defined its reporting boundaries 
in accordance with the NGER framework. This 
assessment includes facilities where Macmahon has 
operational control, including selected project sites 
and corporate facilities, within Australia only.
The FY25 reporting boundary includes:
• Scope 1: Emissions and energy consumption from 
fuels, explosives, and hydrocarbons purchased  
and used
• Scope 2: Emissions and energy consumption from 
electricity purchased and used
During FY25, Macmahon commenced work to define 
its Scope 3 boundaries and begin establishing a 
baseline. This activity remains in progress, with initial 
boundary-setting and data mapping well progressed, 
and further refinement planned in FY26.

Materiality
Following the acquisition of Decmil in FY25, 
Macmahon reviewed the materiality assessment 
to reflect its expanded operations across 
mining and civil infrastructure. The assessment 
considered both financial and impact materiality 
in line with the principle of double materiality, 
and considered feedback from both internal and 
external stakeholders.The outcomes continue to guide Macmahon’s 
evolving ESG strategy and disclosure priorities 
over the coming years, and ensure the 
sustainability agenda reflects the expectations of 
both internal and external stakeholders.

Scope 1 and 2 Emissions
Scope 1: 9,30 1 t CO2-e
*Scope 1 refers to direct GHG emissions and 
associated energy consumption from activities 
under Macmahon’s operational control.
TABLE 1: GHG EMISSIONS AND ENERGY UNDER MACMAHON'S OPERATIONAL CONTROL
UNIT FY25 FY24* FY23*
GHG emissions - Scope 1 t CO2-e 9,301 894 1,091
GHG emissions - Scope 2 t CO2-e 3,203 977 913
Total GHG emissions (Scope 1 and 2) t CO2-e 12,504 1,871 2,004
Energy consumed GJ 155,422 19,726 22,148
*Note: Emissions and energy from previous reporting periods are from Macmahon’s previously reported totals and does not include 
activities associated with Decmil. As a principal contractor, Decmil may periodically assume operational control, consistent with 
industry practice where clients delegate day-to-day management and operational authority during the construction phase.
Climate Strategy
Macmahon’s direct GHG emissions and energy 
use are closely tied to the number and type of 
projects where we hold operational control. In 
the civil and infrastructure sector, this control is 
typically more variable due to shorter project 
durations and differing contractual responsibilities 
compared to mining projects. To respond, 
we have focused on improving data quality, 
clarifying emissions boundaries, and identifying 
opportunities for efficiency at sites where we hold 
operational control.
Macmahon also recognises the importance of 
understanding and addressing indirect  (Scope 3) GHG emissions. This includes engaging 
with clients and suppliers to identify opportunities for 
carbon reduction across project delivery. 
One example is our participation in Caterpillar’s 
Pathways to Sustainability’ program. 
Climate-related emissions targets will be considered 
as part of Macmahon’s broader approach to 
emissions management, following completion  
of Group-wide Scope 1, 2 and 3 baseline assessments, 
including those arising from the integration of Decmil.GHG Emissions and Energy
In FY25, we completed a review of our GHG 
emissions reporting boundaries and calculation 
methodology to ensure alignment across the 
Group following the acquisition of Decmil and 
internal business restructuring, and to meet 
evolving reporting requirements.
We report Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions 
and energy consumed from Australian activities 
under our operational control, as defined by the 
NGER framework , or otherwise accepted through 
contractual obligations. The Decmil acquisition led to a notable increase 
in Macmahon’s GHG emissions and energy use 
in FY25, primarily due to operational control of 
several civil and infrastructure projects.
Despite this increase, Macmahon did not meet 
the thresholds for mandatory reporting under the 
National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 
2007 (Cth) in FY25.
All data was internally verified by management.
Scope 2: 3,203 t CO2-e
*Scope 2 refers to indirect GHG emissions and 
associated energy consumption from electricity 
purchased and used at facilities under Macmahon’s 
operational control.
