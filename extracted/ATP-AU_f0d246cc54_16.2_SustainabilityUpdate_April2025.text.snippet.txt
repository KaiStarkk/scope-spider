TOPIC SUMMARY MEASURE RESULTENVIRONMENTEMISSIONSRising greenhouse gas emissions since the Industrial Revolution have led to ocean warming and acidification 
- both of which pose serious threats to marine life, including the oysters we rely on.
At Atlas Pearls, we recognise our responsibility to monitor and manage our environmental footprint. We will 
report our Scope 1 and 2 emissions on a 12-month rolling basis, using normalised per pearl harvested to account for the seasonal nature of our operations.Kilograms of Co

WASTEProtecting the pristine environments where we operate is crucial to preserving the marine ecosystems on which our business depends.
In remote areas with limited infrastructure, waste management is challenging. Our strategy focuses on 
reducing waste at the source, with a strong emphasis on reuse and recycling wherever possible.
We’ve recently standardised recycling and reuse procedures across all sites and, starting with FY2025, will 
provide detailed reporting on waste categorisation and outcomes.KPI to be launched in August 2025KPI to be launched in August 2025SOCIALGENDER 
EQUALITYEquality of opportunity is a core aspect of our sustainability agenda. Atlas Pearls employs nearly 1,000 people, with a workforce of 30% women and 70% men, plus around 200 casual workers across our operations.
We believe in supporting the best person for each role, regardless of gender or background, to build a high-
performing, inclusive business.
Our gender pay analysis, conducted across all operating countries, reveals a negative gender pay gap - 
meaning, on average, women at Atlas Pearls earn more than men, based on both mean and median figures.Mean and median gender pay ratio of male to female for all Atlas Pearls locations. Based on staff employed at 31 December 2024. 
COMMUNITY 
HEALTHThe physical and mental wellbeing of our staff and local communities is essential to our shared success. Access to healthcare in these remote locations can be limited, and important health issues - particularly those affecting women - are often under-addressed or remain taboo.
To help close this gap, we operate our own on-site health clinic and have partnered with charitable 
organisations specialising in women’s health. Together, we are working to improve health outcomes, raise awareness, and provide much-needed support where it’s needed most.Atlas funded healthcare interactions (including education, prevention and treatment), preceding 6 months total.
EDUCATIONAtlas Pearls supports youth education and empowerment in remote Indonesian communities by providing school scholarships and free English lessons. These initiatives help break down barriers to education, offering children the opportunity to improve their future prospects through learning and skill development.Students sponsored to attend school during the year.

High-quality pearls depend on pristine oceans and thriving ecosystems. Each of our 
farming sites is carefully selected for its remote, pristine, natural environments where oysters can flourish and produce exceptional pearls. While this remoteness fosters healthier oysters, it also presents unique operational challenges.
Long-term sustainability requires preserving these delicate ecosystems while simultaneously 
reducing emissions and minimisng waste, often in areas with little to no infrastructure. Many of our sites operate off grid, where waste and recycling facilities are non-existent, making sustainable practices both essential and complex-not only for our operations but also for the surrounding communities, which play a crucial role in maintaining ecosystem health.
Our programs and initiatives take a creative, localised approach, providing tailored solutions 
that align with the needs of each region. These efforts are reinforced by educational programs designed to drive lasting, meaningful change.Environment.

PAGE 6

=== Page 7 ===
Our strategy is built around three core principles:
Reduction - Minimising waste generation at the 
source. Reuse - Giving materials a second life, wherever possible. Recycling - Turning waste into new resources to prevent environmental impact.
Protecting the pristine environments where we 
operate is vital to our long-term sustainability. Managing waste in remote, infrastructure-limited areas presents unique challenges - but also opportunities to innovate.
Our waste strategy centres on reduction, reuse, 
and recycling wherever possible.•
 I
n FY2025, we standardised waste and 
recycling procedures across all sites.
•
 W
e’ve implemented a site-level weighing 
and categorisation system, enabling detailed data collection on waste types, volumes, and disposal methods.
•
 F
rom FY2025 onward, we will publish 
comprehensive waste data, improving transparency and accountability.
Much of our waste is repurposed rather than discarded. For example:•
 Old o
yster panels are donated to local 
fishermen for practical reuse.
•
 W
e also process marine debris collected 
through our beach clean initiatives - even though this waste doesn’t originate from our operations.
•
 T
hese efforts not only reduce environmental 
impact but also support surrounding communities, fostering a culture of shared responsibility and circularity.
Impact Project: Beach Cleans
Marine debris - especially plastic - poses a long-term threat to remote coastal ecosystems. In areas with minimal human activity, accumulated waste often goes uncollected unless we act.In H1 FY2025, we collected over 702 kg of marine debris, primarily plastic waste.
We run weekly small-scale beach cleans, and 
organize larger community events following storms or high ocean currents.
These efforts not only protect our environments 
but also raise community awareness and engagement.
Impact Project:  Reuse & Recycle
The Gudang Ibu Yunus initiative transforms plastic waste into durable, useful products - turning a local challenge into an opportunity.
•
 Using a shr
edder and extruder, the team 
repurposes HDPE plastic into planks.
•
 Each plank r
emoves ~3 kg of waste, 
or about 50 plastic bottles, from the 
environment.
•
 T
hese are used to create furniture, 
construction materials, and more.
The program supports environmental goals and creates local economic opportunity, contributing to a circular economy.Emissions Management
Rising greenhouse gas emissions contribute to ocean warming and acidification, directly threatening oyster health and pearl quality. We acknowledge our responsibility in addressing this global issue.
•
 W
e report Scope 1 & 2 emissions per pearl harvested, using a 6-month historic rolling basis to 
account for seasonal harvest variations.
•
 Our main ener
gy use stems from:
•
 M
arine vessels used for tending oysters
•
 Land-based facilities
, often powered by local generators in remote areas
•
 Ener
gy use is driven by both operational needs and grid access limitations
We continue to explore and invest in lower-emission alternatives and operational efficiencies.  
This includes:•
 L
everaging economies of scale to reduce overall fuel usage
•
 Optimising fleet log
istics to minimise travel distances and idle times
•
 D
eploying vessels that are 30% lighter, resulting in significant fuel savings
•
 I
mproving fuel-use efficiency across our operations
These efforts reflect our ongoing commitment to reducing our carbon footprint while maintaining operational excellence.
