"Climate Adaptation, Resilience"
and Transition
Macmahon continues to monitor and report
Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions to improve visibility
of our operational impacts and strengthen
alignment with emerging requirements under
AASB S2.
Climate Change
Macmahon recognises the operational and
strategic risks posed by climate change and
the increasing need to support a low-carbon
economy. We are working to reduce our
"emissions footprint by improving data quality,"
"identifying energy efficiency opportunities, and"
collaborating with clients on decarbonisation
efforts. As a contractor to critical mineral and
"infrastructure projects, we also contribute to the"
global energy transition.
