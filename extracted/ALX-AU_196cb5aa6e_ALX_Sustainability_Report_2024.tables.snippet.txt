Greenhouse gas emissions,
Greenhouse gas accounting,Greenhouse gas emissions have been calculated based on the equity share approach in the Greenhouse
,Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard. Values represent 30.98% of APRR (excluding
,"ADELAC) being the average of equity share in H1 2024 (31.14%) and H2 2024 (30.82%), 31.01% of ADELAC"
,"being the average of equity share in H1 2024 (31.17%) and H2 2024 (30.85%), 66.67% of Chicago Skyway"
,"emissions and 100% of Dulles Greenway, Warnow Tunnel and Corporate emissions for the full year. Energy"
,usage is shown at 100% for all businesses except where noted for APRR.
Scope 1,"Greenhouse gas emissions derived from natural gas, fuel use and refrigerants directly used by Atlas"
,"Arteria or its businesses, and calculated based on an equity share approach. For US businesses, emission"
,"factors for fuels (including diesel, gasoline/petrol, natural gas, kerosene and propane) are sourced from"
,"the US EPA GHG Emissions Hub. For Warnow Tunnel, emissions factors for fuel (diesel and gasoline/petrol)"
,are sourced from UBA. For the Luxembourg office the emissions factor for natural gas is a global factor
,"sourced from CBAM. For all wholly and majority-owned businesses, the emissions factors for refrigerants"
,are sourced from UK Greenhouse gas reporting: conversion factors 2024 (Department for Energy Security
,"and Net Zero). For France (APRR, including AREA), emission factors are determined by Agence de la"
,transition écologique (ADEME).
Scope 2,Greenhouse gas emissions associated with the consumption of purchased electricity and district heating
(location-based emissions),"by Atlas Arteria or its businesses, are calculated based on an equity share approach. Emission factors"
,for each location are based on average emissions intensity of the grid.
,Australian emissions are based on emission factors sourced from the National Greenhouse Accounts
,(2024). German and Luxembourg emissions are based on emission factors sourced from the Association
,of Issuing Bodies (AIB) (2023). The US emission factors are based on US Environmental Protection Authority
,"(epa) eGRID state factors (2023 data, as released January 2025)."
Scope 2,Greenhouse gas emissions associated with the consumption of purchased electricity and district heating by
(market-based emissions),"Atlas Arteria or its businesses, are calculated based on an equity share approach. All wholly and majority-"
,"owned businesses purchased 100% renewable electricity in 2024, through a combination of GreenPower"
,purchases direct from the retailer (Warnow Tunnel and Corporate offices) and Renewable Energy Certificates
,(US businesses). The market-based emissions factor applied to electricity usage for these businesses was
,therefore zero. (Note that Warnow Tunnel also has scope 2 emissions generated by the use of district heating).
Scope 3,Indirect greenhouse gas emissions associated with customer use of the businesses’ motorway networks.
(customer emissions),Scope 3 customer emissions are not owned or controlled by Atlas Arteria and have been calculated based
,on the data gathered from customer distance travelled and type of vehicles and utilising emission factors
,sourced from the UK Greenhouse gas reporting: conversion factors 2024 (Department for Energy Security
,"and Net Zero) for passenger and delivery vehicles. This dataset is publicly available and updated each year,"
,providing a source of recent information that is differentiated by vehicle class.
,The following estimates have been used to determine customer distance:
,Warnow: actual length of the toll road given only one exit route.
,Dulles Greenway: the average estimated distance covered by each vehicle class is based on a field study
,"and analysis performed by Dewburry, a third-party consultancy firm."
,"Chicago Skyway: full length of road is 7.8 miles and partial trip distance is assumed to be 5.4 miles, which"
,is the distance from the beginning of the road to the Stony Island ramp. It is estimated that 11% of all trips
,"are a partial trip (i.e. 11% of all trips exit at Stony Island ramp), which is based on the historical average"
,proportion of vehicles exiting at Stony Island ramp from 2019 to 2024. All other partial trips are assumed
,to be full length trips if the exit is not at Stony Island.
Targets,Atlas Arteria has set total scope 1 and 2 emission reduction targets of 25% by 2025 and 46% by 2030
,(from a 2019 baseline). Atlas Arteria’s GHG reduction targets are assessed based on the market-based
,methodology for scope 2 emissions. The 2019 scope 2 baseline was calculated using location-based
,"emission factors from the IEA for each of our businesses in the absence of more localised information,"
,except the Melbourne office which used an Australian (state of Victoria) National Greenhouse Accounts
,(2019 factor).
