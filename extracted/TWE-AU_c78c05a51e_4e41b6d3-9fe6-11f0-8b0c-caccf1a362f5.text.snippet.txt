TREASURY WINE ESTATES – CULTIVATING A BRIGHTER FUTURE REPORT 2025We are pleased to present our 2025 Cultivating a brighter future Report, reflecting 
another year of meaningful progress to build a resilient business, foster healthy and inclusive communities, and produce sustainable wine.Message from the Chairman and CEO
Across our global operations, our teams are leading 
initiatives that respond to the changing climate, use natural resources more responsibly, and create positive outcomes for the people and communities where we operate. The focus on sustainability at all levels in the organisation is having an impact inside our business, in our operating regions, and across the global wine industry more broadly.  
The safety of our people remains a non-negotiable priority. 
In F25, we continued to build a culture of safety through our Build Safe Together campaign and leadership training. These efforts contributed to a reduction in serious safety incidents and lost-time injuries across the business, helping us move closer to our long-term ambition of Destination Zero Harm. Embedding a safety culture means we protect what matters most: our people.
We are working to ensure responsible business practices 
underpin everything we do. In F25, we advanced key priorities in environmental stewardship, climate resilience, world-leading innovation and building a diverse and inclusive workforce - reflecting our commitment to cultivating a better future for everyone who touches our business and our products.This year, we were proud to achieve 100% renewable electricity across our global operations - an important milestone in our commitment to reach net zero (scope 1 and 2) by 2030. Electricity represented around 60% of our footprint when the target was set, and we’ve achieved the transition through onsite solar generation, renewable energy certificates and power purchase agreements. The switch to renewable significantly reduces our greenhouse gas emissions while also building long-term resilience across our network.
Collaboration remains a cornerstone of our approach. 
This year, we deepened partnerships with leading organisations including Australia’s national science agency, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), to future-proof our vineyards through research and breeding programs to cultivate climate-resilient rootstocks. In a major milestone for the long-term research program, the first new-generation vines - combining the heritage of our iconic Coonawarra and Barossa vineyards with mildew-resistant traits - were planted at Wynns Coonawarra Estate in late 2024. Through this long-term collaboration, we’re adapting to a changing climate while reducing the inputs needed in the vineyard and preserving the integrity of Australian wine for future generations.TREASURY WINE ESTATES – CULTIVATING A BRIGHTER FUTURE REPORT 2025
6Driving progress at scale also means contributing to the broader dialogue on sustainability. This year, we participated in the World Business Council for Sustainable Development’s Two Lakes Dialogue and the World Agri-food Innovation Forum in China, where we shared insights and learned from global leaders across the public and private sectors at the intersection of agriculture, environment, innovation and climate. A global engagement program to share our progress with our regional teams complements our ongoing work with industry, government and local communities to shape shared sustainability outcomes. 
We’re continuing to invest in being a smarter business, 
with a focus on metering technology to provide real time data and insights for gas, electricity and water. In a major milestone, smart water meters are now installed across all our production sites located in high- and medium-risk catchments, providing greater visibility of our water usage and enabling us to use this precious resource more efficiently. Our Treasuring Water strategy continued to guide our water stewardship efforts, including a range of dam lining and covering projects that help us reduce evaporation and make the most of our water storage facilities.
Sustainability certification continues to play an important 
role across our operations. Today, 98.4% of our eligible owned and leased winery and vineyard sites hold regionally-relevant sustainability certification. Certification has a range of benefits that go beyond our operations: it promotes biodiversity and long-term soil health, and also improves traceability and transparency – helping customers and consumers make more informed choices and demonstrating our commitment to mindful custodianship of our local ecosystems and responsible production practices. We will continue to ensure our growers obtain and maintain these certifications.
We’ve kept investing in innovation. In South Australia’s 
Barossa Valley, we commissioned a world-first, $15 million integrated automation system that delivers precision, safety and efficiency benefits in our barrel hall. Another step towards creating a hub of sustainability, technology and innovation at the Barossa Valley site was the launch  of our production facility dedicated to no-alcohol and low-alcohol (NoLo) wine featuring a patent-pending process that locks in flavour as the alcohol is removed from wine. This represents a major milestone in our ambition to lead the NoLo category through scaled innovation, enhanced wine quality and flavour, and more choice for consumers looking to moderate their consumption of alcohol. This investment also supports our broader commitment to advocating responsible consumption and meeting the expectations of today’s wine drinkers.We proudly launched our inaugural Reflect Reconciliation Action Plan in Australia, strengthening engagement with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples and showcasing long-standing relationships with First Nations peoples and Country pioneered by many of our vineyard teams across several decades. 
Our efforts in sustainability were recognised by a range 
of prestigious awards programs. We were finalists in the London-based Reuters Global Sustainability Awards 2024, and finalists in the agriculture and environment category of The Australian Financial Review Sustainability Leaders Report 2024. In the US, we were finalists in the sustainability category of Fast Company’s Best Workplaces for Innovators list, and in Australia our Barossa Valley automation project was recognised in the best technology category in the Food & Drink Business Hive Awards. 
Throughout the year, we’ve seen the positive impact of our 
sustainability agenda through stronger outcomes, deeper partnerships, and a growing culture of innovation. In the years since we launched our enhanced sustainability strategy, our achievements have provided a strong foundation – but there is more to do. We remain an agricultural business at our core, and we recognise the need for meaningful impact: for our business, our industry, our communities, and our planet. 
As we reach the midway point in this decade for action, 
maintaining momentum is critical to ensuring a resilient, thriving tomorrow.
