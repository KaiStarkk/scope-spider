4  |  MICHAEL HILL INTERNATIONAL LIMITED  |  ESG REPORT 2025This year, we refreshed our customer research and were 
heartened to see an 8% increase in support for our 
sustainability efforts. Our customers recognise the impact 
we’re making - whether it’s empowering women, reducing 
our carbon footprint or giving back to our communities. 
Their engagement validates our strategy and inspires us to 
keep pushing forward.
I am proud of the progress we’ve made this year and the 
passion our team brings to this work. From achieving a 
79% reduction in scope 1 and 2 emissions to planting 
over 124,000 trees through the Michael Hill Foundation, 
our actions have demonstrated that our brands and our 
products are deeply connected to our people and planet.
Thank you for joining us on this journey.

EXECUTIVE COMMENTARY 
AT THE MICHAEL HILL GROUP, 
SUSTAINABILITY IS NOT JUST A 
COMMITMENT - IT’S A CORE PART OF 
WHO WE ARE AND HOW WE OPERATE. 
THIS YEAR’S ESG REPORT REFLECTS THE 
EVOLUTION OF OUR APPROACH AND 
THE IMPORTANCE OF TRANSPARENCY IN 
EVERYTHING WE DO.
You’ll notice a change in the name of this report. As we 
prepare for Australia’s first mandatory climate reporting 
period in FY26, we’ve renamed this publication our ‘ESG 
Report’ to distinguish this voluntary reporting from the 
mandatory Sustainability Report that will be included 
in our FY26 Annual Report. Our continued commitment 
to voluntary reporting is essential for accountability of 
delivering our 2030 Sustainability Strategy goals.
We are also aligning the cadence of our ESG reporting with 
our goals, shifting to a calendar year cycle in future. This 
change will allow us to report more meaningful ESG updates 
to stakeholders on progress against our 2030 goals. Our 
next ESG Report will cover the period from July 2025 to 
December 2026 and will be published in early 2027.

15  |  MICHAEL HILL INTERNATIONAL LIMITED  |  ESG REPORT 2025RE:CYCLE
We are committed to increasing the volume of customer 
pieces and material returned to precious metals supply 
chain. Gold is the ultimate circular material as it can be 
repeatedly refined and repurposed without losing value  
or purity. 
This year, our Re:Cycle program was available in Australia, 
New Zealand and Canada and encourages customers to 
recycle gold jewellery products in exchange for a Michael 
Hill gift card. PRODUCT PILLAR
RE:STORE
We are committed to increasing the volume of products we 
repair for our customers. After a successful launch in New 
Zealand last year, we expanded our repair services for non-
Group jewellery products across Australia and Canada. 
This gives our Michael Hill and Bevilles instore customers 
the opportunity to extend their products’ lifespans 
and prevent waste. We repaired a total of 343,809 
jewellery items throughout the year. Supporting jewellery 
craftsmanship and quality remains a priority for the Group 
and we are proud to offer this service for customers. 
CIRCULARITY
We will increase precious metals circularity by using 
recycled precious metals in our products and operating 
circularity programs by 2027.  
PERFORMANCE SNAPSHOT 
•  Returned 3.76kg of gold to the supply chain  
through Re:Cycle
•  Repaired 343,809 pieces of customer jewellery 
•  Offered 67 products made from certified recycled 
gold and silver This year, we: 
• Recycled 3.76 kilograms of gold
• Saved 11,252 tonnes of mining ore*
• Avoided 60,010 kilograms of carbon emissions^
*  This is an estimate only, and is based on a global production-weighted mean 
average (Nassar, Lederer, Brainard, Padila and Lessard, 2022) Operational and 
extraction efficiencies vary greatly between individual mines.
^  Estimating carbon emissions avoided is difficult. Our estimate is based on 
available information which is limited and is based on the aqua regia method 
– the most commonly used high-value gold scrap recycling process – from 
several state-of-the-art German refineries (Fritz, Aichele and Schmidt, 2020).
Circularity is fundamental to protect our planet’s precious 
natural resources and to ensure the longevity of our industry. 
We are looking to expand Re:Cycle to other precious metals 
and expand accessibility to our other brands.

LOWER IMPACT
We will increase our offering of jewellery products  
made with lower impact materials from responsible 
sources by 2027.
This year, we increased our mix of certified sustainable  
lab-grown diamonds across the Group and took steps to 
verify sources of our lab-grown coloured gemstones. 
PERFORMANCE SNAPSHOT
•  100% of Michael Hill and TenSevenSeven  
lab-grown diamonds are certified sustainable
•  Certified sustainable lab-grown diamonds 
represent 17% of Michael Hill’s diamond mix  
and 25% of Medley’s
•  34% of Bevilles’ diamonds are  
lab-grown diamonds 
•  23% of Michael Hill’s and 50% of Bevilles’ 
coloured gemstone products are made with  
lab-grown materials LAB-GROWN DIAMONDS
Certified Sustainable with SCS-007
Across the Group, we are committed to increasing the 
mix of our lab-grown diamonds that are certified to the 
highest level of sustainability assurance for diamonds. 
The SCS-007 standard is implemented by SCS Global 
Services and applies to natural and lab-grown diamonds 
across 5 pillars: origin traceability, ethical stewardship, 
sustainable production, net zero carbon footprint and 
sustainable investments. All certified products come with 
a SCS Certificate of Sustainability describing the diamond’s 
ethical and environmental performance.   
Michael Hill, Medley and TenSevenSeven are some of the 
few accredited retailers of Certified Sustainable diamonds 
under the SCS-007 standard. At the date of this ESG 
Report, Certified Sustainable diamonds are only available 
to purchase from four other retailers in Canada and 
Australia, and two in New Zealand. 
SUPPORTING OUR NET ZERO GOAL 
We are committed to reducing our carbon impact to net 
zero. Supporting this, the original SCS-007 standard 
required producers to offset their greenhouse gas emissions 
and other climate-related pollutants to achieve a climate 
neutral diamond production process. Under the latest 
standard, producers must measure, reduce and balance 
their CO2 emissions to zero through verified actions. This 
new approach focuses on minimising CO2 emissions before 
balancing those remaining, rather than simply offsetting. PRODUCT PILLAR

20  |  MICHAEL HILL INTERNATIONAL LIMITED  |  ESG REPORT 2025REDUCE, REPLACE, OFFSET STRATEGY 
Emissions from electricity use across our store network and 
head office locations make up the largest part of emissions 
from our own operations. As a result, we followed a ‘Reduce, 
Replace, Offset’ strategy to support our net zero goal. 
Reduce
This year, we introduced LED lighting across an additional  
8% of our store network, with 89% of our stores now running 
on LED lighting. We have committed to installing LED lighting 
in the remaining stores as part of our regular refit works. 
To further reduce energy consumption, our instore digital 
display screens have been programmed to automatically 
power down outside of trading hours, eliminating 
unnecessary electricity use across the store network.
PERFORMANCE SNAPSHOT
•  79% reduction in scope 1 and 2 emissions across 
the Group compared to last financial year
•  Achieved a 5-star energy rating for our Global 
Support Centre base building
•  Generated 131mWh through our Global Support 
Centre’s rooftop solar systemZERO CARBON OPERATIONS
We will achieve net zero carbon operations  
(scope 1 and 2) by 2025. PLANET PILLAR
Replace
The Global Support Centre building operates a 99KW rooftop 
solar panel system. This year, we generated 131mWh 
through solar, covering 18% of our electricity requirements. 
For our other sites across Australia and New Zealand, we 
procured green energy solutions that directly support local 
renewable energy generation. 
This year, we transitioned the energy supply for 87 stores 
in Australia and the remaining 2 stores in New Zealand to 
zero emission sources that support 100% renewable energy 
generation. This meant all electricity consumed by our 
stores and support office locations in Australia and New 
Zealand was matched with accredited renewable electricity.

=== Page 21 ===
21  |  MICHAEL HILL INTERNATIONAL LIMITED  |  ESG REPORT 2025AUSTRALIAN RENEWABLES
To achieve our goal in Australia, we voluntarily purchase 
GreenPower and surrender renewable energy generation 
certificates (LGCs) to match our electricity use above 
Australia’s Renewable Power Percentage (RPP). The RPP is 
the portion of electricity that the Clean Energy Regulator 
(CER) requires to be from renewable sources under the 
Renewable Energy Target. The RPP was 18.48% for 2024 
and 17.91% for 2025. This ensures that, in addition to 
the national renewable baseline, we are supporting extra 
renewable energy generation in Australia.
GreenPower is a government-accredited product designed 
to support renewable energy generation. LGCs are created 
through projects such as wind and solar farms and are 
surrendered on our behalf to the CER. 
NEW ZEALAND RENEWABLES
To achieve our goal in New Zealand, we voluntarily purchase 
and redeem New Zealand Energy Certificates (NZ-ECs) via 
the New Zealand Energy Certificate System. These NZ-ECs 
are equivalent to 100% of our electricity use, ensuring 
that our consumption is matched with certified renewable 
energy generated in New Zealand. This year, our purchases 
directly supported renewables at a wind farm in the South 
Island and a solar farm in the North Island. 
These products mean the amount of electricity used from 
the grid in Australia and New Zealand is matched with 
electricity produced from certified renewable sources. 
This allows the Group to report our market-based scope 
2 electricity emissions as zero, using the market-based 
methodology as per the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance. 
CANADIAN RENEWABLES
This year, we developed plans to purchase renewable 
energy for our Canadian store network. We identified a 
renewable energy certificate (REC) provider in Canada and 
intend to purchase Ecologo certified RECs that meet strict 
environmental standards to match our electricity usage to 
reach our net zero goal. 
Offset
While our Replace initiatives address electricity-related 
emissions, some operational emissions remain. These 
represent a small portion of our total footprint and will  
be offset through certified carbon credits aligned with  
our nature restoration goals. 
We plan to procure these offsets in January 2026,  
once our 2025 consumption data is reconciled.
Reduce, Replace Offset in action
This year, the base building of our Global Support  
Centre achieved a 5-star Energy rating and 4.5-star  
Water rating from National Australian Built Environment 
Rating System (NABERS). 
The combination of our onsite renewable electricity 
generation, purchase of renewable electricity products  
and rainwater tanks enabled us to retain these NABERS 
scores for the 2024/25 period. PLANET PILLAR
