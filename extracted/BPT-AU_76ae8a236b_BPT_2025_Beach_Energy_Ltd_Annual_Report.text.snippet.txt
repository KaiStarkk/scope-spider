Letter from the Chair
Following the detailed strategic review 
undertaken in FY24, the implementation of 
an asset-focused organisational structure 
and appointment of new executive 
leadership have underpinned the reset of 
Beach. This includes a renewed focus on 
our core East and West Coast hubs and 
adopting an owner’s mindset focused on 
performance. Beach delivered structural 
cost savings and efficiencies across the 
business, driving a material reduction in 
the pre-growth free cash flow breakeven oil 
price to less than US$30/bbl. As a result, 
Beach is now better positioned to manage 
market volatility and has established a  
low-cost foundation for sustainable,  
value-accretive growth.
Through this period of organisational 
change, Beach safely delivered meaningful 
progress towards its vision of becoming 
Australia’s leading domestic energy 
company. On the East Coast, in FY25 we 
supplied 19% of gas demand from our 
operated assets and our non-operated 
equity interests. This past year saw new 
supply from Enterprise and Thylacine 
West in the Otway Basin, and higher 
volumes from the Bass Basin sold into an 
increasingly tight market. On the West 
Coast, the Waitsia Gas Plant is nearing 
completion, with the secondment of 
experienced Beach personnel providing 
valuable guidance and oversight during  
the commissioning phase.
Completion of the Moomba CCS project 
during the year was a key element of 
Beach’s emissions reduction pathway. 
With Moomba CCS now online, the Cooper 
Basin JV has already abated more than one 
million tonnes of CO 2e, putting Beach on 
track to achieve its target of a 35% equity 
emissions intensity reduction by 2030. 
With a lifecycle cost of less than US$30 
per tonne of CO 2, Moomba CCS is among 
the lowest-cost carbon capture projects 
globally. This is a significant achievement 
for both Beach and Australia’s broader 
decarbonisation efforts.
Those in the industry have long recognised 
the flexibility, scalability, and lower 
carbon footprint of gas relative to coal, 
making it the ideal firming partner for 
variable renewable energy. This was 
clearly demonstrated in June when the 
National Electricity Market on the East 
Coast was once again tested by multiple 
supply challenges. Coal-fired power 
generation suffered outages, still weather 
conditions reduced wind output, solar was 
at mid-winter cyclical lows, and a cold snap increased power demand. Over a 
three-day period, Victoria consumed 13% 
of its annual gas demand for electricity 
generation. Beach played a key role in 
meeting this demand, with the Otway Gas 
Plant operating at nameplate capacity and 
rejuvenated production from the Bass Basin 
contributing to more than 20% of Victoria’s 
gas supply during this time. This clearly 
demonstrates the importance of Beach  
as a domestic energy supplier.
Periods such as these underscore the 
critical role gas plays in the National 
Electricity Market when other sources 
falter. The gas industry has a central role 
to play in supporting Australia’s energy 
security and energy transition toward 
more variable renewable energy sources. 
The greater the proportion of renewables 
contributing to our energy mix, the greater 
the demand for gas to provide firming 
support. To continue playing this critical 
role, Beach and other domestic producers 
need stable, long-term policy settings that 
support and enable confident investment  
in new gas supply.
To this end, over the past year it has 
been encouraging to see a maturing 
recognition of the critical role gas will play 
in underpinning Australia’s energy security. 
The Federal Government’s Future Gas 
Strategy from 2024 and more recent policy 
developments and initiatives are helping to 
create a more supportive environment for 
our industry. However, it is imperative that 
this momentum continues. Further action 
is required to encourage the significant 
capital investment needed to bring new gas 
supply to market, particularly for Australian 
companies investing in domestic supply. 
The recent announcement of the Federal 
Government’s review of the gas market is 
welcomed by Beach and we stand ready 
to contribute. As we have long stated, 
removing regulatory complexities, fast-
tracking approvals and removing acreage 
restrictions to promote exploration should 
be clear objectives of any upcoming policy 
changes. New domestic gas supply is 
the only long-term solution to meeting 
Australia’s energy needs. For a domestic 
gas market with abundant resources, to 
rely on LNG imports should be seen as 
both a policy and market failure. While 
LNG imports may provide short-term 
support, they come at higher cost, and risk 
undermining the case for much-needed 
investment in local supply and midstream 
infrastructure. Dear Shareholders,
FY25 was a year of significant 
progress for Beach. The 
company delivered strong 
financial and operational 
results, while executing key 
elements of its refreshed 
strategy. Beach continues 
to strengthen its position 
as an efficient, resilient, and 
focused supplier of natural 
gas to Australia’s domestic 
markets, with a clear 
commitment to long-term 
value creation.

Production
Total production of 6.8 MMboe was  
64% above the prior year (FY24: 4.1 
MMboe) and comprised 33.6 PJ of sales 
gas (+66%), 55 kt of LPG (+40%) and  
546 kbbl of condensate (+72%). The 
increase in production was largely driven 
by connection to the Otway Gas Plant of 
the Enterprise gas field in June 2024 and 
the Thylacine West 1 and 2 development 
wells in October 2024. Higher customer 
nominations following the new well 
connections also contributed to the growth 
in production. 
Exploration, appraisal  
and development 
Connection of the Thylacine West 1 
and 2 development wells in October 
2024 marked completion of the largest 
ever offshore drilling and development 
campaign in the basin. The campaign saw 
well deliverability for the Otway Gas Plant 
restored above nameplate capacity of 
205 TJ/ day, which has provided greater 
flexibility to service East Coast gas demand. 
Beach entered a rig consortium with other 
offshore Victorian operators to contract 
the Transocean Equinox rig. Beach will 
utilise the Equinox rig for the next phase 
of offshore activity across the Otway and 
Bass basins. The initial phase of activity is 
expected to include plug and abandonment 
of the Geographe 1, Thylacine 1 and White 
Ibis 1 wells and drilling of the Hercules 1 gas 
exploration well. Hercules 1 is a material, 
moderate to high-risk, gas exploration 
prospect targeting the Waarre C reservoir 
in the Otway Basin. 
The Equinox rig will then undertake 
activities for other rig consortium members 
before returning to Beach later in FY26. The 
second phase of activities is expected to 
include abandonment of two wells in the 
Bass Basin, drilling and completion of the 
La Bella 2 development well, completion of 
the Artisan discovery, a well intervention 
and completion of the Hercules well (if a 
discovery is made).  
The Equinox rig campaign will be  
followed by subsea development and  
well connections, subject to FID and usual 
approvals processes, with first gas in  
CY2028 targeted. Acreage description

Production
Total production of 1.4 MMboe was 91% higher than the  
prior year (FY24: 0.8 MMboe) and comprised 6.5 PJ of  
sales gas (+92%), 14 kt of LPG (+94%) and 216 kbbl of 
condensate (+87%). The increase in production was largely 
attributable to a low-cost production optimisation initiative 
which involved applying downhole descaling chemicals  
across all producing wells.
Abandonment
Planning and preparation for the next phase of offshore Victoria 
activity progressed. The Equinox rig campaign will include plug 
and abandonment of the currently suspended Trefoil 1, Yolla 1 
and White Ibis 1 wells. 
Acreage description
Bass Basin operations include production from the Yolla field, 
situated approximately 140 km off the Gippsland coast in 
licence T/L1 (Beach 100%). Gas from the Yolla field is piped 
to the Lang Lang Gas Plant located near the township of Lang 
Lang, approximately 70 km southeast of Melbourne. Beach also 
holds a 100% interest in licences T/L5, T/RL4 and T/RL5, which 
capture the Trefoil, White Ibis and Bass discoveries. Beach also
