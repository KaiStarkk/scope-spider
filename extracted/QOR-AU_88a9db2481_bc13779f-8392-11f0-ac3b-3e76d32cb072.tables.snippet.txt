"W
e seek to minimise the environmental impact of our"
products & services.
"Protecting our communities, customers & workforce"
"Qoria recognises that while climate change is a serious challenge for society at large, it also could have"
"direct impact on our communities, as well as our operations. This includes extreme weather, supply"
"chain disruption, compliance with emerging climate-related regulations, policies and laws."
We have an important role to play in ensuring responsible use of energy consumption to protect our
global communities.
Emissions & energy consumption in data & hosting
Qoria is investing in world leading cloud sustainability. Our most signiﬁcant environmental footprint is in
the cloud data and hosting services procured from third party cloud providers such as Google Cloud
"Platform (GCP), Amazon Web Service (AWS) and Microsoft Azure."
"Qoria has an ongoing strategic partnership with GCP, which has strong sustainability and environmental"
credentials. Google has set ambitious targets to achieve net-zero emissions across their operations and
"value chain by 2030 and reduce 50% of combined Scope 1, 2 (market-based), and 3 absolute emissions"
(compared to their 2019 base year) by 2030. Google also plans to invest in nature and
technology-driven carbon removal solutions to neutralise remaining emissions.
"Qoria continues to actively migrate workloads out of other cloud platforms and into GCP, and by doing"
"so, we are improving our emissions visibility and ensuring that our workloads are taking advantage of"
Google’s world leading emissions reduction targets.
