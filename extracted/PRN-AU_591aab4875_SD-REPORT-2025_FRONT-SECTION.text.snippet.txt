A message from the Chair of the  
Safety and Sustainability Committee
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to 
present Perenti’s FY25 Sustainability Report. 
This year, we have focused on deepening 
our commitment to preventing adverse 
life changing events, creating safe and 
respectful workplaces and supporting the 
mining sector’s transition to a safer, more 
resilient, and lower-emissions future. 
Throughout FY25, we continued to embed our 
Sustainability Blueprint, which is grounded in the 
Perenti principles and guides how we deliver enduring 
value and certainty across our operations.
We had zero fatalities in FY25, a meaningful improvement 
from previous years and a reflection of our strong and 
ongoing commitment to eliminating high-consequence 
risks. During the year, we reviewed divisional critical risk 
bowties for single and multiple fatality scenarios, improving 
our understanding of critical controls and we transitioned 
to divisional ownership of Safety Transformation Plans, 
structured around people, technology and systems. 
These plans are driving practical, site-level improvements 
tailored to local needs. We strengthened safety governance 
through Quarterly Safety Performance Reviews (QSPRs), 
increased field verifications, and improved visibility via 
our HSE Central platform. A focus on near-miss reporting 
has resulted in a significant uplift which helped identify 
systemic risks without consequences, helping to reinforce 
a proactive and organisational learning safety culture.
In FY25, we made further progress in developing a more 
inclusive culture. This year, we focused on supporting 
our leaders to build psychological safety in their teams 
and encouraging the reporting of harmful behaviour, 
through our managing harmful behaviour and being an 
active bystander training programs. We also broadened 
opportunities for early-career pathways, enhanced 
frontline leadership development, and bolstered inclusive 
recruitment efforts. Female representation in leadership 
roles continued to increase. However, we recognise that 
more work is needed to achieve our goal of 33% female 
representation across the workforce by the end of FY33. As a major employer in remote and regional areas globally, 
we continue to play an important role in supporting local 
employment and building workforce capability within 
host communities. We strengthened our commitment 
to creating further social value through the development 
of a Social Value Investment Framework, which we 
plan to launch in FY26. This framework will guide 
measurable investment aligned with local priorities and 
stakeholder needs. Across our operations, we continued 
to contribute significantly to local communities through a 
combination of community partnerships, direct donations, 
sponsorships and infrastructure support. Initiatives 
included local school infrastructure, youth programs, 
cultural events, sports and infrastructure, many of which 
provided opportunities for employee volunteering, 
fundraising and engagement with local communities.
As a diversified mining services company, Perenti is 
uniquely positioned to facilitate decarbonisation across 
the mining value chain. In FY25, we continued to 
advance our capability in lower-emission technologies, 
both within our operations and through client-focused 
solutions such as mine electrification studies, a diesel 
hybrid equipment trial, hydrogen-based systems and 
solar-powered infrastructure. These efforts demonstrate 
our practical contribution to emissions reduction as 
well as progressing our own Net Zero commitments. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to take this 
opportunity to thank our employees and contractors, 
who have helped us deliver on our sustainability priorities 
and targets and extend my thanks to our clients, local 
communities and shareholders for your ongoing support.

ABN 95 009 211 474At Perenti, we recognise the critical role we must play in helping the world transition to a 
more sustainable future. To deliver on our purpose, to create enduring value and certainty 
for all stakeholders, sustainability must be embedded in everything we do. It informs how 
we operate, innovate and care for our people, communities and the environment.

** Senior Leaders include Group Executive, Vice Presidents, General Managers and Department Heads.Our commitment is guided not only by our Sustainability 
Blueprint, but also by the Perenti principles, the shared 
values that underpin our decisions and define how we work. 
These principles, No shortcuts, Never wasteful, Walk in their 
shoes, Smarter together,  and Enable tomorrow , reinforce our 
responsibility to act ethically, lead with care and continuously 
improve across all domains of sustainability.
In FY25, we continued to implement our Sustainability 
Blueprint, which is built around three enduring imperatives:
• Caring for our people and communities
• Valuing the environment and enabling the energy 
transition
• Acting ethically and responsibly.Our approach to sustainability
These imperatives are underpinned by five sustainability 
priorities, each championed by an executive sponsor and 
integrated across all divisions:
• Preventing adverse life changing events
• Creating safe and respectful workplaces
• Achieving gender balance
• Accelerating decarbonisation
• Partnering with our communities.
Our sustainability priorities are closely linked and contribute 
to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
included in our Sustainability Blueprint. Progress against 
these priorities are supported through Group-wide initiatives, 
defined targets, and investments that deliver tangible 
sustainability outcomes.2
Perenti Sustainability Report 2025

=== Page 5 ===
This FY25 Sustainability Report (Report) outlines Perenti’s 
performance against our Sustainability Blueprint, structured 
around our three sustainability imperatives. This Report 
includes achievements, challenges and performance against 
targets, supported by data and case studies from across  
Perenti (Perenti; Group) for the period 1 July 2024 to 30 June 
2025 (unless otherwise stated). The organisational control 
boundary for the reporting period remained unchanged in 
FY25, ensuring comparability with prior reporting periods. 
This Report is embedded in our FY25 Annual Report. It is 
also available as a separate report on Perenti’s sustainability 
webpage. When reviewing the digital report, it should 
be noted that topics such as governance, enterprise risk, 
operating model and other matters that are covered by the 
financial reporting requirements are contained within those 
sections of the FY25 Annual Report. 
In FY25, we completed further assessments in accordance 
with the Australian Modern Slavery Act 2018 (Cth). Our fourth 
Modern Slavery Statement was completed in November 
2024. We also reported our gender diversity performance 
to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA) for our 
Australian operations. 
Our sustainability reports, including our FY25 Sustainability 
Databook, are available at perenti.com/sustainability.

Materiality assessment
In FY25, we conducted a comprehensive materiality 
assessment. The materiality assessment involved a detailed 
desktop assessment, an extensive internal and external 
stakeholder engagement program and internal workshops 
to establish the sustainability issues that are important to 
our business and our stakeholders. From this process, the 
material topics were determined to be:
PRIORITY 1
Health and Safety
Employment Practices
Local communitiesPRIORITY 2
Climate adaption and resilience
Non-discrimination and 
equal opportunities
Anti-bribery and anti-corruption
Governance
Rights of Indigenous Peoples
During FY26, we will be re-evaluating our Sustainability 
Blueprint to align with the outcomes of the FY25 Materiality 
Assessment, and updating our targets, where required.
Our continued focus is to embed safety and sustainability 
in everything we do, to build operational resilience, deliver 
long-term positive impact and position our business to 
thrive as the world transitions to a more sustainable future.
Forward-looking statements

Sustainability Databook include forward-looking statements, 
forecasts, estimates and projections regarding future 
events, circumstances, targets, commitments and the future 
performance of the Group in relation to environmental, 
social, governance, climate change and broader sustainability 
matters (Forward-looking Statements). 
The Forward-looking Statements do not constitute factual 
statements, guarantees, or predictions and are not intended 
to provide guidance on the future sustainability performance 
of the Group. The Forward-looking Statements are based 
on the Group’s beliefs and expectations as at the date of 
the publication of the FY25 Sustainability Report and reflect 
judgements, assumptions, estimates and other available 
information as at the date of the Report. Readers are 
cautioned not to place undue reliance on these statements.
No representation or warranty, express or implied, is given 
as to the accuracy, reliability, completeness or correctness, 
likelihood of achievement or reasonableness of any Forward-
looking Statement or the assumptions that underlie them. 
Forward-looking Statements are subject to known and 
unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of 
which are beyond the Group’s control, and which may 
cause the actual sustainability results, performance or 
achievements of the Group to differ materially from those 
expressed or implied in the statements contained in the FY25 
Sustainability Report.
The Forward-looking Statements are made as at the date 
of the publication of the FY25 Sustainability Report. Except 
as required by applicable regulations or law, the Company 
does not undertake any obligation to publicly update, 
supplement or revise any information in this report (including

information or future events.Alignment with frameworks
This Report has been prepared with reference to the GRI 
Standards, including the GRI 14: Mining Sector 2024 Sector 
Standard, alongside the relevant topic standards. We have 
also identified the SDGs that align with our sustainability 
imperatives and priorities. Our climate change and energy 
transition disclosures are aligned with the recommendations 
of the Task Force on Climate -related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD), embedded within our governance, strategy, risk 
management and metrics disclosures. We are actively 
transitioning to meet the Australian Accounting Standards 
Board (AASB) S2 Climate -related disclosures.
