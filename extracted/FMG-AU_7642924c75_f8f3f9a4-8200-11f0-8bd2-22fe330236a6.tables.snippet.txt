political and economic landscape. This risk is largely,
driven by the technical and operational complexity,
of deploying zero-emissions technologies across our,
operations and managing critical dependencies such as,
"land access, transmission infrastructure, and regulatory",
approvals. We are also exposed to potential timing,
"mismatches between the availability of green products,",
"market demand, evolving regulatory requirements,",
and our own ambition. We view our Real Zero Target,
transition not only as a corporate responsibility but as,
"a strategic advantage, and failure to deliver on these",
commitments would pose significant reputational risks.,
The transition to a low-carbon economy and the growing,
demand for low-emission solutions presents Fortescue,
with a range of opportunities. Our business strategy,
is designed to capitalise on and accelerate this shift,
"by delivering the products, technologies, services and",
"energy required for industrial decarbonisation, creating",
new pathways for growth and diversifying our revenue,
beyond traditional iron ore.,
