Our Commitment: Greenhouse 
Gas (GHG) Emissions Reporting    
Johns Lyng Group intends to extend 
its current sustainability initiatives to deliver long-term value and benefits to 
our stakeholders. We note the increasing 
interest of stakeholders regarding both the risks and opportunities relating to 
the impact of climate change.  
During FY25, the Group will be improving 
its reporting on environmental matters 
in order to meet future reporting requirements. This will include 
identifying baseline emissions prior  
to the introduction of mandatory emissions and sustainability  
reporting requirements.
