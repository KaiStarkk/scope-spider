EMISSIONS,,,,,,
GWA progressed its emissions strategy by,,,,,,
integrating low-emission solutions across,,,,,,
operations and product offerings. This included,,,,,,
"evaluating renewable energy supply, expanding",,,,,,
"the hybrid fleet, optimising local logistics, and",,,,,,
partnering with international freight providers,,,,,,
to explore rail transportation options to,,,,,,
lower emissions.,,,,,,
GWA’s approach is grounded in data-driven,,,,,,
"monitoring of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions,",,,,,,
and laying the groundwork to review and,,,,,,
consider Scope 3 emissions. These initiatives,,,,,,
form part of GWA’s ESG Roadmap.,,,,,,
ENERGY,,,,,,
Energy consumption from GWA’s business,,,,,,
"facilities spans across seven offices, three",,,,,,
experience centres and six distribution centres.,,,,,,
GWA continues to generate solar power from,,,,,,
"its distribution centres at Prestons, NSW and",,,,,,
"Pinkenba, QLD.",,,,,,
"The Prestons site, equipped with a 250kW",,,,,,
"solar panel system, saw a 6% decrease in solar",,,,,,
"generation in FY2025, producing 314,139kWh",,,,,,
"compared to 334,354kWh in F2024. In contrast,",,,,,,
"the Pinkenba site, with a 100kW system,",,,,,,
"generated 143,025kWh in FY2025, nearly",,,,,,
"doubling its output from 72,728kWh in FY2024.",,,,,,
This solar initiative helped GWA avoid,,,,,,
"370 tonnes of CO₂ emissions in FY2025,",,,,,,
up from 280 tonnes in FY2024.,,,,,,
