WAYNE BRAMWELL  
Westgold Managing Director and Chief Executive OfficerMESSAGE FROM OUR 
MANAGING DIRECTOR AND 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER 
Westgold is pleased to present this update on our 
sustainability journey for the 2024 financial year (FY24). 
Our performance this year built on strong foundations 
established in FY23, a transformative year, in which we 
simplified the business and reset our operating culture 
to be a safer, more profitable and progressive gold 
producer. 
The robust financial performance and operational 
efficiency achieved in FY23 provided a firm foundation 
for our ongoing sustainability initiatives in FY24. 
This financial strength allows us to make strategic 
investments in technologies and infrastructure that 
optimise resource utilisation and contribute to a 
sustainable future.
FY24 saw substantial progress across our ESG goals. 
Westgold is committed to leading the way within the 
gold mining sector when it comes to taking action 
against climate change. The successful completion 
and commissioning of hybrid (solar/gas/diesel) 
power stations at four of our facilities represents a 
major milestone in our decarbonisation strategy. This 
achievement reduced our greenhouse gas emissions 
by 21% since 2022 while simultaneously enhancing 
operational efficiency.
Our focus on continuous improvement translates 
into ongoing strategic investments in cutting-edge 
technologies and infrastructure that propel us towards 
continued growth while optimising resource utilisation 
and contributing to a sustainable future.

4.1 OUR APPROACH 
Our collaborative approach supports the protection and 
restoration of local ecosystems while respecting the 
cultural heritage of the lands on which we operate:
 – We work closely with Native Title holders and 
Indigenous communities to safeguard their 
cultural practices and knowledge, fostering a deep 
understanding of the land and its history.
 – Our Environmental, Social and Governance 
Policy , Environment and Community Policy  and 
Risk Management Policy  provide a framework for 
responsible environmental stewardship.
 –Effective oversight is provided by the Sustainability 
Committee, supported by the ESG Working Group, 
Environment and Community Team, and Indigenous 
Relations and Heritage Committee. This collaborative 
structure supports responsible land management and 
integrates stakeholder perspectives. 
 – We are harnessing the potential of technology to drive 
operational efficiency and environmental performance. 
Investments in on-site renewable energy, advanced 
water treatment, and waste reduction technologies 
are central to our strategy. We are embracing 
digital solutions to optimise operations, identify 
environmental risks and track progress toward our 
sustainability goals.
Westgold prioritises open communication and 
engagement with stakeholders to identify areas of shared 
importance. Our FY23 materiality assessment revealed 
a strong alignment between our sustainability goals and 
stakeholder priorities. Key topics include:
 – Implementing strategies to reduce our carbon footprint 
and mitigate climate change risks.
 – Optimising energy consumption across operations 
while exploring the integration of renewable energy 
sources.
 –Implementing effective land restoration practices to 
leave a lasting positive impact on the environment.
 – Building and fostering strong relationships with 
Indigenous and local communities.
4.2 CLIMATE ACTION 
Climate change presents both challenges and 
opportunities for Westgold’s operations and broader 
value chain. Increased frequency and intensity of 
extreme weather events pose physical risks, while 
policy changes around carbon emissions and investor 
preferences for sustainable practices introduce 
transitional risks.
To navigate these challenges and achieve our climate 
goals, Westgold has established a Climate Change 
Action Plan (CCAP), which outlines our approach to 
mitigating climate change impacts on our operations 
and contributing to a sustainable future. Aligned with 
the National Climate Risk Assessment (Department 
of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment and 
Water, 2024), the CCAP identifies key climate risks, 
establishes a framework for adaptation and mitigation 
strategies, and sets measurable goals for continuous 
improvement, including specific performance 
requirements. We aim to reduce greenhouse gas 
emissions through energy efficiency improvements, 
electrification and water conservation. Additionally, 
we are building resilient infrastructure by diversifying 
water sources, collaborating with communities to 
prepare for climate impacts, and making upgrades 
to withstand extreme weather events. We are also 
actively managing transitional risks by understanding 
policy changes, carbon pricing, and shifting investor 
preferences towards sustainability.
4.2.1  Assessing and responding 
to climate risk 
Westgold conducted a high-level climate change 
risk assessment in FY24 to identify key physical and 
transitional risks, including rising temperatures, 
altered precipitation patterns and extreme weather 
events. By assigning likelihood and consequence 
levels to these risks, we have prioritised areas for 
focus and developed targeted adaptation strategies.
