Sustainability and ESG
Our Approach
PEXA takes pride in operating ethically and responsibly. 
We are committed to positively impacting our people, 
our communities and our environment. Our ESG approach 
aligns with our purpose of 'connecting people to place', 
supports our business objectives and seeks to deliver long 
term value for our shareholders and our people.
Our ESG Strategy
We continue to refine  our ESG approach and build on our 
ESG Framework designed to ensure our activities align 
to our strategic focus areas and material issues. In FY25 
we collaborated across our Australian and UK operations 
to create our ESG Strategy Action Plan. This two-year 
roadmap, extending through FY26, outlines specific 
objectives, targets, and metrics to effectively manage both 
current material issues and emerging opportunities.
We have identified  four interconnected pillars in our ESG 
Framework and Strategy:•Governance : Ethically and responsibly manage our key 
risks, uphold best practice governance and communicate 
openly with stakeholders.
•Customer and Product : Delivering secure digital 
infrastructure, insights and improving customer 
experience by enabling innovation and partnering with 
the right suppliers.
•People and Community : Supporting industry and our 
communities to make positive change, by leveraging 
our people and their talents who lead with a better 
together culture.
•Environment : Protect our natural assets for future 
generations by supporting sustainable communities, 
managing carbon emissions and climate risk.
This integrated approach ensures that ESG principles are 
embedded across our operations, we focus on the issues 
most material to our customers and stakeholders and we 
measure performance.

Ethical Business Principles
PEXA upholds our business ethics through our governance 
processes, policies, advisory committees and by supporting 
a transparent and open culture. We operate in line with 
our Code of Conduct and Ethics Policy with country-
specific  policies, governance and controls in place. The 
Board is ultimately responsible for ESG at PEXA with the 
Board Audit and Risk Committee (ARC) holding specific 
responsibilities within the Charter.
The ARC has oversight of all material risk and compliance 
matters with accountability to review, monitor and make 
recommendations on data protection and privacy and 
ethical governance and ESG strategy items, climate 
disclosures, emissions, Modern Slavery Statement and 
Responsible Sourcing Policy.
The ARC reviews and monitors PEXA’s management 
of cyber risks, documentation, frameworks, reporting 
and any related policies. ARC considers significant  data 
and privacy matters, including privacy reform, incidents 
and pertinent updates with significant  matters referred 
to Board. Group wide corporate governance policies, 
committees and PEXA’s Risk Management Framework 
continue to guide the strategies, activities and metrics that 
support our disclosures.
Regulatory
The PEXA Australian Exchange operates within a 
multi-tiered regulatory framework that governs our 
eConveyancing operations. This structure incorporates 
regulatory oversight at Federal and State levels, establishing defined  parameters for service delivery and 
customer protection.
The regulatory architecture consists of three primary 
components: the Model Operating Requirements (MOR) 
administered by the Australian Registrars National 
Electronic Conveyancing Council (ARNECC); operational 
agreements with State and Territory Registrars and 
Revenue Offices;  and Reserve Bank of Australia supervision 
of payment systems. Additional oversight exists through 
ASX listing requirements and the Security of Critical 
Infrastructure Act, following PEXA's designation as a Critical 
Infrastructure Asset in 2024.
The Model Operating Requirements (MOR) specifies  that 
PEXA’s established fees cannot exceed CPI each year 
without regulatory approval. The Independent Pricing and 
Regulatory Tribunal (IPART) NSW is undertaking a second 
review of PEXA's pricing (last undertaken in 2019), which 
is expected to be completed in June 2026. Operational 
requirements are precisely defined  within the regulatory 
structure. Our platform must maintain a service reliability 
threshold of 99.8% during core hours, while adhering to 
comprehensive information security protocols and system 
resilience standards.
Electronic Lodgement Network Operators (ELNO) must 
support universal access for eConveyancing including 
the lodgement of all available document types and 
provide equitable access. In addition to platform 
availability requirements, the NSW Registrar imposes 
customer service metrics such as acceptable support call 
waiting times.
