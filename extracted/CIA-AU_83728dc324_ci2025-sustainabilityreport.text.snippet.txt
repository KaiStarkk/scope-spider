FY2026 Targets
and Indicators
Throughout the 2025 financial year, we 
reviewed and optimized our sustainable devel-opment objectives, ensuring that they are aligned with the expectations of our stake-holders. This comprehensive process aims to exceed the standards set by our stakeholders, while also prioritizing a safe and environmen-tally sound working environment. In order to develop a robust strategy of short, medium and long-term goals, the Company selected the following targets and indicators to track its performance year over year, across key material topics. These were developed with input from internal subject matter experts and our management team, as well as being informed by industry risk and performance management trends, investor priorities, and a range of relevant stakeholder priorities.FY2026 Sustainable Development Objectives

Planning for Transition Risk
The study undertaken in 2023 did not consider transition risks or potential opportunities 
linked to climate change. However, our previous 2019 climate study did consider some potential opportunities, such as longer summers positively influencing energy consumption. This example could provide energy savings due to a reduced need for seasonal heating, as well as accelerating revegetation during reclamation activities. Building on these efforts, we initiated a comprehensive analysis of transition-related risks and opportunities during the reporting period, with a focus on financial materiality, to help inform and strengthen our climate risk mitigation strategies. 
We recognize that our operations are energy intensive and that we may be impacted by 
current and emerging policies and regulations relating to GHG emission levels, energy efficiency and reporting of climate change-related risks. While some of the costs associated with reducing emissions may be offset by increased energy efficiency and technological innovation, the current regulatory trend may result in additional transition costs relating to the Company’s operations. In addition, global efforts to transition to a lower-carbon economy may entail extensive policy, legal, technological, and market changes to address mitigation and adaptation requirements related to climate change. Depending on external factors, transition risks may pose varying levels of financial and reputational risk to the business. 
Energy and GHG Management
Benefiting from access to renewable hydropower, Champion ranks among the lowest in GHG intensity (scope 1 & 2) per tonne of high-grade iron ore produced. Despite our already competitive positioning, our Company continues to analyse and invest in opportunities to further reduce its GHG emissions aligned with our decarbonization objectives. As part of our commitment to reduce emissions, we will consider adapting to any potential future increases in Canada’s Nationally Determined Contribution (“NDC”), under the United Nations IPCC, that may flow through to the private sector. While our decarbonization efforts continue, emissions from our mining activities account for only approximately 1% of our scope 3 emissions. Accordingly, our focus remains on enhancing our products to help reduce emissions in the steelmaking process.Scope 1 & 2 Emissions: A Detailed Plan Enabling Our TargetsSince the recommissioning of Bloom Lake in 2018, we achieved an average annual emissions reduction of 25% of CO
2e per annum when compared to 2014, when the mine 
was closed by the previous owner. To achieve such results, substantial investments were completed, allowing the Company to reduce its emissions as highlighted in the graphic above. Notably. the ore conveyor system, the tailings pumping system and the electric boilers were major projects that resulted in significant operational emission reductions.0102030405060708090100110120130140150

& Methodology
During FY2024, in collaboration with an internationally 
reputable consulting firm, we mapped our supply chain emissions and 
    developed a methodology in line with GHG
 
Protocol guidance from the WRI and the WBCSD to esti-mate our Scope 3 emissions. During the reporting year, the Company completed and disclosed its initial Scope 3 assessment for its FY24 activities, in alignment with our previously set objective. In this report, we disclose our Scope 3 emissions for the FY2025 period, marking the first time we include Scope 3 emissions in our sustain-ability report.
Our methodology for calculating Scope 3 emissions is 
based on a category-specific approach as defined by the GHG Protocol and based on several third-party emission benchmarking, including leading global data providers. We conducted a thorough assessment of all the catego-ries and retained those that are applicable to our opera-tions, including those listed below.  
For each category, we assess the availability of the data. We then select emission factors that are applicable to the specific items within these categories. As a result, we utilize multiple emission factors, each reflecting the emission intensity of different items.
