To better identify, understand and  
assess the impacts of our operations  
on biodiversity, we continue to progress 
our knowledge of nature-related risks  
and opportunities using the LEAP 
approach (Locate, Evaluate, Assess, 
Prepare). Following work done to 
understand how our assets and operations 
interface with nature in protected areas, 
this year we moved to evaluate the 
Group’s key dependencies and impacts  
on nature-related areas. This evaluation 
found that our mining and agricultural 
operations have higher dependencies  
and impacts on areas such as land and 
water, reflecting the key nature interfaces 
across these assets. This assessment 
process will be integrated into our  
annual risk review processes under the 
Group Enterprise Risk Management 
Framework, preparing us for future 
nature-related disclosures.

Cultural heritage 
We respect the connections of Traditional 
Owners and custodians with the lands 
where we operate, and recognise that 
sites, objects and artefacts of cultural 
significance must be proactively identified 
and protected. We manage cultural 
heritage obligations and responsibilities  
in accordance with approved cultural 
heritage management plans. We consult 
and engage with traditional owner group 
representatives at each of our mining 
operations, being Wanaruah Local 
Aboriginal Land Counci (WLALC) at 
Bengalla Mine and the Western Wakka 
Wakka People (WWWP) at New Acland 
Mine. A representative of the WLALC is 
an active member on the Bengalla Mine 
Community Consultative Committee.  
We continue to engage with 
representatives of the WWWP to  
ensure any proposed ground disturbance 
at New Acland for Stage 3 operations 
considers impacts on cultural heritage  
and action to avoid harm, or where harm 
cannot reasonably be avoided, minimise 
harm to cultural heritage. We aim to 
embody the principle of free, prior and 
informed consent in our engagement  
with traditional custodians to ensure  
our impacts on cultural heritage are 
managed respectfully and sustainably. 
During the reporting period the Group  
did not receive any complaints related  
to the rights of First Nations people or 
traditional custodians. 
Operational emissions
New Hope reports on Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (also referred 
to as ‘operational emissions’), energy consumption and energy production to the Clean 
Energy Regulator annually, in accordance with, and using the methodology set out under, 
the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER) Scheme. Reflecting the timing  
of reporting requirements under the NGER Scheme, data presented below is for the year  
to 30 June 2024 on an operational control basis. 
Total emissions (tCO 2-e)
Emissions classification 30 June 2024 30 June 2023
Scope 1 667,497 595,100
Scope 2 60,641 58,456
Total operational emissions 728,138 653,556
We have separately reported our gross absolute Scope 1, Scope 2 emissions on an equity 
share basis and estimates for total Scope 3 emissions for the current reporting period in 
our Climate-related information report at page 46 of this Annual Report. 
The main source of operational emissions at our mine sites come from the fugitive emissions 
released in the coal extraction process, the combustion of fuels in heavy earthmoving 
equipment, and the consumption of energy in the form of electricity purchased for use  
in our operations. For our total Scope 1 emissions reported under the NGER Scheme  
for the period ending 30 June 2024, fugitive emissions accounted for 67 per cent.

Reducing operational 
emissions
We recognise that operational 
decarbonisation presents a significant 
challenge for our business.
As both of our operating mines currently 
have scheduled lives into the mid to late 
2030s, anticipated return from investment 
in operational emissions reduction initiatives 
using existing technologies (both financial 
and relating to abatement) are limited.
We have reported on our greenhouse gas 
emissions targets and metrics monitoring 
this year in our Climate-related information 
report, available from page 46 of this 
Annual Report 2025.
From 1 July 2023, under the Safeguard 
Mechanism, Bengalla Mine is required to 
progressively reduce and/or offset Scope 1 
emissions against a determined baseline 
by 4.9 per cent per annum to 2030. 
Presently, we manage operational 
emission reduction requirements through 
the purchase of Australian carbon credit 
units (ACCUs). We are also investigating 
potential opportunities to directly reduce 
our operational emissions with focus  
on Bengalla Mine as set out following.Diesel emissions
We frequently review and update the 
mine schedule to maximise production 
and improve efficiency at our mine  
sites, including to reduce our fuel use  
and emissions.
At Bengalla Mine, we use a fuel 
management system to understand, 
analyse and adjust our vehicle movements 
and maintenance schedule to improve 
efficiency. In recent years we have 
implemented initiatives to reduce fuel  
use, such as truck tray upgrades and 
changing mine layouts and roadways. 
We have also investigated trolley-assist 
haulage and in-pit crushing and conveying 
and have determined these to be 
unsuitable for our operations due to the 
layout of Bengalla Mine, notwithstanding 
changes made to reduce fuel usage.
This year Bengalla Mine pioneered a 
project to ‘repower’ Komatsu 930E-5  
and 830E-5 trucks, replacing the existing 
engine with a higher performance engine 
prior to the trucks entering operations.  
One of the key considerations in 
implementing the repower project was  
fuel burn saving, which was estimated  
in feasibility studies to achieve up to 20 to 
25L of fuel savings per hour. Early analysis 
of fuel burn data indicates fuel savings 
above estimates. We will continue to 
review the progress of this initiative  
to measure and better understand fuel 
efficiency opportunities and potential  
for related emissions reduction.At present, we have determined there  
is no alternative-fuelled fleet solution 
currently commercially available at the 
scale required to operate Bengalla Mine 
efficiently, particularly as the existing  
fleet is relatively new. We continue to work 
with equipment manufacturers  
to understand the feasibility of using 
alternative fuels for the mining fleet  
and other equipment on site.
Fugitive emissions
Fugitive emissions occur when coal  
is exposed during the mining process, 
releasing CO 2 and methane inherent in  
the coal seam. The nature and volume  
of emissions depend on both the coal 
resource properties and the mining method.
This year at Bengalla Mine, we completed  
a conceptual study on the potential for 
recovering fugitive emissions that would 
involve drilling wells to enable fugitive  
gas extraction and destruction. We are 
now undertaking further assessments 
which includes drilling techniques, 
available technologies and associated  
cost considerations. 
We are cognisant of the inherent 
challenges in capturing fugitive emissions 
for open-cut coal mines, where the 
emissions are diffuse across a relatively 
small land area. Any future fugitive 
emissions capture project at Bengalla 
Mine would require regulatory review  
and approval before proceeding to more 
detailed planning and potential execution.SUSTAINABILITY REPORT CONTINUED

New Acland’s greenhouse gas emissions 
profile further limits opportunities for 
feasible emissions capture projects. 
Nevertheless, we keep a watching  
brief on opportunities to reduce  
Scope 1 and 2 emissions assessing 
potential feasibility based on their cost 
and suitability to the mine.
Electricity use
Indirect greenhouse gas emissions from 
purchased electricity contribute a relatively 
smaller amount to our overall emissions 
footprint and we expect our Scope 2 
emissions from electricity use to decrease 
as the overall electricity grid decarbonises. 
During the year we undertook a detailed 
engineering design study at Bengalla Mine 
for a modest scale solar PV and battery 
storage project for on-site power 
requirements. The results of this study 
determined challenges in establishing  
and maintaining the project, from both a 
financial and environmental perspective, 
particularly beyond the life of the mine. 
The available locations within the mining 
lease boundary further limited the 
potential to use our land to generate 
renewable electricity to feed into the grid. 
We continue to investigate potential 
opportunities in developing a large-scale, 
alternate energy facility on Group-owned 
land nearby New Acland Mine comprising 
a pumped hydro complex, including on-site 
solar and wind generation that would take 
advantage of the site’s topography and 
location within the Southern Queensland 
Renewable Energy Zone.If determined feasible, the intent is that the 
complex would operate alongside active 
mining operations and continue post-
mining to support long-term value creation 
and local employment opportunities. 
Generating carbon credits 
We are also considering carbon 
sequestration projects on land at our 
agricultural operations for potential  
future generation of Australian Carbon 
Credit Units (ACCUs). In particular, we are 
investigating opportunities to adjust our 
land management practices  
at Bengalla Agricultural Company,  
to achieve increased productivity and  
soil carbon levels through soil carbon 
sequestration. We engaged third party 
experts to conduct soil carbon testing 
during the year. Preliminary results indicate 
good potential for our land to support a soil 
carbon sequestration project, and we are 
progressing with registration requirements 
for a project under the Federal ACCU 
Scheme (previously the Emissions 
Reduction Fund). 
A similar soil carbon testing project  
at Acland Pastoral Company was 
undertaken in the reporting year;  
whereby soil cores were drilled and 
analysed across landholdings to determine 
the potential. Preliminary findings  
indicate that soil absorption levels may 
support the development of a similar  
soil carbon sequestration project,  
subject to further review of economic 
feasibility and practicality.

Strengthened domestic policy regarding decarbonisation or restrictions on coal industry
Description • Increasing domestic climate-related regulation and policy commitments and/or strengthened domestic 
decarbonisation targets, for example changes to the Safeguard Mechanism decline rate or introduction of new 
carbon taxes, that impact our operations. 
• Strengthened domestic decarbonisation targets and policy focus impact decision-making processes for coal  
mining approvals.
Decarbonisation policy
Risk category Transition risk (Legal, policy)
Time horizon Short to medium term
Assets  
vulnerable  
to riskBengalla Mine is more vulnerable to this risk as an operation emitting more than 100,000 carbon dioxide equivalent 
(CO 2-e) emissions annually and therefore subject to the Safeguard Mechanism. New Acland Mine is not currently  
subject to the Safeguard Mechanism as its CO 2-e emissions are below the prescribed threshold.1 
Description  
of riskIncreasing domestic climate-related regulation and policy commitments increase compliance requirements such  
as carbon pricing frameworks and operational emissions limits under schemes such as  
Australia’s Safeguard Mechanism.
Potential and/or 
anticipated 
impacts• Increased costs to meet compliance requirements. Current modelling suggests that if New Hope relies solely on 
purchasing Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs) to satisfy the emissions reduction targets under the Safeguard 
Mechanism, then the cost will be immaterial to our financial position.
• Additional capital required for investment in operational decarbonisation and lower-emissions technology projects.
• Reduced production targets required to meet operational emissions limits, causing reduced product sales and 
decreased revenue.
Mitigation and/or 
adaptation 
approach• Regular monitoring and stakeholder engagement to understand the likely future policy landscape.
• Investment in industry associations to support policy advocacy and consultation initiatives.
• Continued implementation of Enterprise Decarbonisation Framework to monitor decarbonisation obligations  
and ensure these are factored into Group capital management decisions.
• Use of our carbon pricing model to monitor the market and leverage opportunities for carbon credit acquisition.
• Continue to undertake technical studies to understand emissions profile for assets and model emissions  
reduction trajectories under Government-led targets. 
• Continue to investigate carbon sequestration and storage opportunities, including at our agricultural operations 
adjacent to our mines, to contribute to direct decarbonisation with mutually beneficial agricultural productivity 
outcomes. For example, during the 2025 financial year we engaged third party experts to conduct soil carbon 
testing on land at Bengalla Agricultural Company. Based on preliminary results indicative of potential for a soil 
carbon sequestration project we are progressing with registration requirements for a ACCU generation project  
under the Federal ACCU Scheme (previously the Emissions Reduction Fund). We intend to conduct similar soil 
carbon sampling on land at Acland Pastoral Company during the 2026 financial year.
1. At 31 July 2025, the Safeguard Mechanism defines ‘covered emissions’ as relevant Scope 1 emissions under the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting 
Act 2007 and applies to operations emitting more than 100,000 tonnes of CO 2-e annually.
