CDC’s inaugural Sustainability Report 
marks an important milestone in our 
history as a mission-critical data  
centre provider. 
I founded the organisation in Canberra 
in 2007, during the Millennium Drought, 
with a vision to provide purpose-built 
data and digital infrastructure for the 
most important entities that underpin 
Australia’s security, social and economic 
wellbeing. Faced with ongoing water 
scarcity and wary of compounding 
this environmental strain, I adopted a 
‘clean and green’ ethos from day one, 
which included world-leading water 
conservation practices as a core part of 
the early vision for the company.
The trust of our customers in the years 
since has enabled our organisation to 
work hard to grow from a small data 
centre provider with an ambitious 
mission, to become a critical 
infrastructure provider for organisations 
across Australia and New Zealand, 
committed to deliberate and thoughtful 
approaches to identifying, tackling 
and reporting on a wide range of ESG 
themes. 
This journey fills us with great pride and 
inspires us for the future. 
We know that as our business has 
grown, so have the expectations of 
our stakeholders. We also know that 
in the broader community, the debate 
continues on a wide range of policy 
options and approaches and public 
discourse is not settled on a single path 
for Australia’s energy transition.
CDC plays a critical role in supporting 
operations, systems and services 
required for national progress. Our large-
scale and highly secure infrastructure 
supports customers across industries 
which keep the world and our society 
functioning and thriving, accelerating 
economic growth and enabling scientific 
research and innovation. 
In that regard, our business is at the 
centre of 21st century industry and 
innovation, powering and enabling critical 
services, from aviation and banking to It is exciting to see the progression 
of CDC's ESG journey through clear 
documentation of its sustainable action, 
innovative solutions and transparent 
reporting.
This report highlights the company's 
achievements, cementing CDC's 
standing as a progressive organisation 
committed to driving positive change 
across the sector and the communities in 
which it operates. 
In particular, the board welcomes the 
following milestones:
• Launching our 2030 ESG Strategy, 
which sets our targets for net zero 
carbon by 2030 for Scope 1, 2 and 
defined Scope 32 
• Installing ~90 kW of solar panels at 
our Eastern Creek campus
• Producing our first Indigenous 
Participation Plan3 
• The certification of Toitū enviromark 
diamond for our New Zealand Data 
Centres4 
This report offers information for 
our investors, customers and the 
communities in which we operate on how 
we are actively managing the threats and 
opportunities inherent to ESG issues. 
Strengthening resilience to climate and 
social-related risk is imperative for our 
industry and this report represents the 
significant work we are undertaking to 
safeguard our financial future against 
these risks.
Transparency and responsibility are 
long-standing pillars of the organisation 
and the publication of our ESG targets 
and goals demonstrates CDC's ongoing 
commitment to accountability. Welcome from Board Chair Welcome from CEOIntroduction
social welfare, communications and 
emergency forecasting, which help 
futureproof Australia’s and New Zealand’s 
continued progress.
CDC is a security-focused organisation 
with its facilities achieving some of the 
highest protective security standards. 
We know our customers can trust their 
data is secure with CDC, now and in the 
future. 
Data centres aggregate the energy 
demand required to power customer 
critical systems. They do so while 
being optimised for power efficiency, 
thus contributing to grid power savings 
when compared to on-premises energy 
consumption. At the same time, the data 
centres help provide stability in the grid 
due to their constant load. 
As technology continues to evolve 
and underpin more of everyday life, 
the demand for data centre services is 
expected to increase in the decades to 
come. As such, we are very mindful of 
our role as an individual organisation and 
as a leader in the digital infrastructure 
sector as we embark on the journey 
ahead.
This Sustainability Report outlines our 
three ESG pillars: Stable planet, Thriving 
people and Trusted company – and 
explains the action we are taking across 
each one to make a difference. 
It is not only a story of a job well done. 
It is the start of an ongoing evolution. 
We will celebrate our successes and 
progress while remaining ambitious and 
realistic about the work still ahead. 
I look forward to continuing to update 
you on our progress in the years to 
come. 
Regards,Explaining our approach to ESG 
matters encourages all stakeholders to 
understand the business's position and 
how we aim to improve in certain areas. 
We hope that this will ultimately enable 
CDC to attract long-term capital from 
like-minded investors who are aligned 
with the national interest and care about 
sustainability the way we do. 
This enables us to move from strength to 
strength and steadily grow our portfolio 
with those who align with our values 
over the coming years.
On behalf of the board, I sincerely 
congratulate the team at CDC, its 
external partners and their suppliers 
for their important role in driving a 
positive change across the industry. The 
incredible dedication, hard work and 
effort are truly appreciated.
The board is excited to continue to 
support the CDC team to provide 
industry leadership and deliver on their 
commitments, targets and Sustainability 
Reporting. 
Regards, 
Greg Boorer  
Chief Executive OfficerBrett Chenoweth

reporting period from 1 April 2023 to 
31 March 2024 (FY24). It also includes 
data points that are historical and up-
to-date at the time of publishing, to

our ESG Statement of Commitment, 
annual Modern Slavery Statement, public 
NGERS data and Workplace Gender 
Equality Agency report. Together these 
documents provide a comprehensive 
overview of CDC’s sustainability 
approach.About this report

Our engagement approach Stable planet
Reducing our environmental impacts and 
improving sustainability practices is a 
major focus for our team. This extends 
from our efficient designs and the 
provision of 100% renewable electricity14, 
to using reduced embodied carbon 
and certified sustainable materials in 
construction and seeking to minimise 
operational waste across campuses. 
We are proud of our industry-leading 
water conservation practices, particularly 
our closed-loop chilled water system 
design. The technology requires almost 
no operational water consumption 
for primary cooling from our cooling 
systems, possibly making CDC one of 
the most water efficient data centre 
operators15 in Australia and New Zealand. 
Looking to work harder and build on this 
achievement, we have set the ambitious 
target of net zero carbon by 2030 for 
Scope 1, 2 and defined Scope 316. 
CDC’s approach to net zero is to focus 
on material emissions through energy 
efficiency improvements, the provision of 
renewable electricity17 and on-site solar 
generation. We are addressing embodied 
carbon in our new data centres through 
the specification of sustainable certified, recycled content and reduced carbon 
materials18. We intend to develop a 
detailed climate transition plan to align 
with ASSB standards and to address 
fossil fuels and refrigerants, although 
these represent a small component of 
CDC’s emissions. 
Our New Zealand data centres have 
been Toitū net carbonzero certified 
since 2022, whilst in Australia, we have 
offered our customers 100% renewable 
electricity19 from 1 January 2024. 
CDC seeks to undertake best practice 
for operational waste management to 
lead us towards achieving our zero waste 
to landfill by 2030 target20. This includes 
on-site weighing of waste and multiple 
waste streams to optimise recycling 
including paper and cardboard, organic 
waste, co-mingled recycling, metals, 
timber, batteries and e-waste.
When we consider the ‘Stable planet’ 
pillar, our focus is not just to meet 
expectations but to exceed them. We 
are seeking to drive innovation and set 
a benchmark for our industry colleagues 
to follow, as the sector shifts towards a 
lower carbon future. Carbon and energy
