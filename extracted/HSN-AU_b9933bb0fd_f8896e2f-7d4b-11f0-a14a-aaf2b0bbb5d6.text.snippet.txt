Supplier Assessment Sustainability Databook Sustainability Strategy GHG Emissions
In FY24 we launched our 
Supplier Code of Conduct 
seeking supplier alignment 
with the code.
In FY25, we initiated a 
sustainability assessment  
of our largest suppliers  
by spend, to identify risks 
and opportunities across 
our supply chain.
This process helped 
establish a baseline 
understanding, laying 
the groundwork for 
future expansion of 
the assessment and 
engagement program.We defined key sustainability 
metrics and incorporated 
them into a detailed 
Sustainability Databook, 
ensuring transparency and 
structured reporting. 
This document seeks to 
provide stakeholders with a 
comprehensive view of our 
sustainability performance, 
tracking progress against 
established benchmarks 
and enhancing our  
reporting transparency  
and capabilities.Hansen’s Sustainability 
Strategy was formally 
introduced, aligning 
business operations with 
long-term sustainability 
objectives. This initiative 
involved company wide 
engagement. These activities 
continue to be supported by 
our codes and policies.Completed benchmarking of 
our FY24 global Scope 1, 2, 
and 3 GHG emissions. This 
provides a critical foundation 
for our future plans to set 
science-based emissions 
reduction targets and 
helps refine our long-term 
decarbonisation strategy 
and climate transition plan.
Climate Active Climate ScenariosASRS Readiness 
Assessment Material Topics
We successfully recertified 
with Climate Active in FY24 
for our Australian Operations. 
Hansen’s focus will begin  
to shift from Climate  
Active carbon neutral 
certification to establishing  
an emissions reduction 
pathway aligned with the 
Science-Based Targets 
initiative (SBTi) principles.
While offsetting remains  
an option for hard-to-abate 
emissions in the future,  
our immediate priority  
is on measurable  
emissions reductions.Utilising independent 
experts, a comprehensive 
climate scenario analysis 
was conducted to assess 
high-priority risks and 
opportunities related  
to climate change. This 
analysis enables proactive 
risk management and 
strategic planning, ensuring 
that our business remains 
resilient in a transitioning 
global economy.To align with evolving global 
sustainability reporting 
requirements, we conducted 
an AASB S2 readiness 
assessment and enhanced 
our sustainability reporting 
structure. This process 
ensures that our disclosures 
remain transparent,  
robust, and progressively 
aligned with emerging 
international standards.A refreshed materiality 
assessment was undertaken 
with broad internal and 
external stakeholder 
engagement across  
our global operations.  
This process helped identify 
and prioritise the most 
significant Environmental, 
Social and Governance 
(ESG) topics, ensuring that 
our sustainability strategy 
and reporting remains 
aligned with Hansen’s 
broader business strategy 
and reflects the expectations 
of investors, customers,  
and regulatory bodies.FY25 ROADMAP PROGRESS

Hansen is disclosing GHG emissions data for its Americas, APAC & EMEA (excluding powercloud) operations for the first time on a retrospective basis for FY24.  
This unaudited data supports transparency around Hansen's sustainability performance. As this is an initial disclosure, methodologies may evolve with improved  
data quality and changing standards. Hansen encourages users to consider the context of each metric, noting sustainability data is dynamic and may be updated  
in future reports.
    By measuring, managing, and reducing emissions across our operations, supply chain,  
and product usage, Hansen contributes to climate action and responsible consumption  
— supporting SDGs 12 and 13.GHG emissions

In FY23 Hansen set itself the challenging target of reducing  
the absolute emissions of our Australia operations by no less 
than 40% by the end of FY26 from FY22. We didn’t just beat 
this target we achieved it two years early. 
We replaced our older Australian data centres with more 
energy efficient outsourced centres and encouraged 
employees to engage with emissions reduction activities.
After our reduction activities we offset 100% of our Australian 
operations’ emissions and have achieved Climate Active 
carbon neutral certification for FY21–FY24. 
Benchmarked our global GHG emissions
In preparation for Australia's upcoming mandatory  
climate-related disclosure requirements under AASB S2, 
Hansen is retrospectively disclosing its global Scope 1-3  
GHG emissions for FY24.
By establishing this global baseline, Hansen is laying the 
foundation for the establishment of science-based reduction 
targets and a climate transition plan that reflects the full scale  
of Hansen's operations and value chain.

SUSTAINABILITY REPORT CONTINUED
Key Findings
Physical Risks:
Under both scenarios, Hansen’s operations may be affected by climate-related hazards including rising temperatures,  
rainfall variability, and sea level rise. The high emissions scenario presents greater physical risk exposure, including:
 ●Europe: +3.1°C warming by 2060
 ●South Asia: +9.3% increase in rainfall
 ●Coastal sites: Up to +0.23m sea level rise by 2050
These changes elevate chronic risks, including risks of flooding, infrastructure stress, and heat-related productivity losses, 
particularly in Vietnam, India, Europe, and North America.
Transition Risks and Opportunities:
Under the low emissions scenario, accelerated decarbonisation and digitisation are expected to drive strong global demand  
for Hansen’s software solutions, including billing, DER management, and grid analytics. Supporting trends include:
 ●Investor preference for low-carbon technologies
 ●Strong regulatory signals in Europe and Australia
 ●Market growth of digital utilities at 9.5% CAGR to 2030
Under the high emissions scenario, policy progress is fragmented, with fossil fuels remaining dominant in many regions.  
Impacts include:
 ●Slower client decarbonisation, with fewer use cases related to complex renewable energy systems
 ●Continued software uptake, but with reduced demand for advanced functionality tied to renewables integration
 ●Increased exposure to Scope 2 emissions, especially in India and Vietnam
 ●Reduced growth in the digital utility market (5.2% CAGR to 2030)
Operational Resilience
Operational and Strategic Resilience
Hansen’s remote-enabled, cloud-based delivery model reduces its exposure to physical climate risks such as localised  
flooding, storm damage, or extreme temperatures. Although offices in Pune, Ho Chi Minh City, and Melbourne may experience 
climate-related disruption under the high emissions scenario, Hansen’s distributed workforce, business continuity planning, 
and flexible leasing arrangements enhance resilience. Hansen’s products are designed to support long-term energy system 
transformation, ensuring strategic relevance across both emissions scenarios.
Capacity to Adapt and Financial Implications
Hansen’s modular and scaleable software suite allows the company to adapt quickly to evolving client needs, policy changes, and market 
dynamics across jurisdictions. This agility is further supported by its low reliance on high-emission assets or long-lived infrastructure.
A full emissions assessment has been calculated for FY24 only at this stage but Hansen has planned for a formal emissions 
reduction strategy and climate transition plan to commence in FY26.
While Hansen has not yet publicly disclosed quantitative data on capital allocation for climate adaptation, its SaaS-driven, 
relatively low capital intensity model offers flexibility to redirect resources as needed.
Hansen has limited exposure to owned high-risk infrastructure. While leased offices and outsourced data centres provide some 
protection from physical risks (supported by contracts that typically include flexible exit or upgrade clauses), these facilities remain 
part of Hansen’s broader value chain. The use of outsourced data centres means that Hansen retains indirect exposure to climate 
risks affecting data centre infrastructure. However, the contracted data centre providers have committed to a comprehensive 
climate resilience strategy, including renewable energy targets and physical risk assessments, which helps mitigate this exposure.
Hansen’s current investment priorities include enhancing its product suite in DER management, real-time analytics, and 
customer-centric energy services—areas that support decarbonisation and grid modernisation.
Uncertainties and Limitations
Model Assumptions: The scenarios rely on IPCC CMIP6 SSP-RCP and IEA pathways, which assume future socioeconomic and 
policy developments that may diverge in practice. 
Physical Risk Projections: Sea level rise, extreme weather, and tipping point events (e.g. ice sheet loss) are subject to uncertainty 
due to model limitations.
Transition Risk Timing: The feasibility and timing of the NZE scenario is highly uncertain, requiring coordinated global action not 
yet evident.
