Greenhouse Gas Emissions
"In FY25 IMDEX’s Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions were 2,831 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide"
"equivalent (tCO2-e). This included 2,006 tCO2-e Scope 1 and 825 tCO2-e Scope 2 (location-"
"based). For FY25, IMDEX has also measured market-based Scope 2 GHG emissions which"
were 790 tCO2-e as an alternative method as recommended by the GHG Protocol Scope 2
Guidance.
In FY25 our GHG emissions increased by 674 tonnes from FY24. This increase is due to in
part the addition of two new emissions sources captured in FY25:

•  Scope 2 - Indirect emissions associated with the company's consumption of purchased electricity in
the base year (e.g. electricity IMDEX buys from the grid for use at our operations).
Organisational and operational boundaries
The FY25 emissions report covers the period from 1 July 2024 to 30 June 2025 and applies
an operational control consolidation approach. IMDEX believes that the use of the operational
consolidation approach is the most appropriate method to measure the Group’s GHG emissions that
aligns with the business. This boundary reflects and accounts for emissions from operations all of
"which IMDEX or one of its subsidiaries has operational control over including warehouses, offices and"
distribution centres.
This report includes Scope 1 and 2 emissions related to the supply and servicing of mining equipment
"for the following geographic regions: Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Europe (Bulgaria, Germany,"
"Netherlands, Norway, United Kingdom) North America (Canada, Mexico, USA), South America"
"(Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Peru), Middle East and Africa (Ghana, South Africa)."
This year’s calculation includes:
"•  Total scope 1 and 2 emissions independent of any GHG trades such as sales, purchases, transfers,"
or banking of allowances.
"•  Scope 1 and 2 emissions for all seven greenhouse gases (CO₂, CH₄, N₂O, HFCs, PFCs, SF₆, NF₃) as"
tonnes of CO₂ equivalent (tCO₂-e).

=== Table 10 (page 62) ===
This year’s calculation includes all locations for which complete and reliable data was available.,
"Several locations were excluded due to the unavailability of data, and no estimations have been made",
"for these exclusions. Additionally, for some of the included locations, only partial Scope 1 emissions",
"data has been reported, with Scope 2 data unavailable and therefore not included.",
"The following sources, facilities, and /or operations have been excluded:",
•,"Lubricant oil, unquantified but estimated to be insignificant (< 1% of total inventory)"
"•  Hydraulic oil, unquantified but estimated to be insignificant (< 1% of total inventory)",
"•  Albion site, QLD electricity consumption due to data unavailability",
"•  Electricity, stationary fuel use and refrigerants for UK, Bulgaria, Netherlands, 12 locations in South",
,"America, Mexico excluded due to data unavailability"
•  Refrigerants for US sites not estimated due to data unavailability.,
Emissions data for all seven GHGs separately was not available for grid electricity / Scope 2 emissions.,
Methodology for the calculation of GHG emissions,
"For the calculation of the Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions, the Group follows the guidelines and",
methodologies contained in the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol: Corporate Standard Reporting,
Standard (2004). IMDEX also refers to the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance in its emissions calculation,
methodology.,
IMDEX follows the directives of the GHG Protocol in its selection of the emissions factors adopted,
"in the calculation of the inventory, whilst the Global Warming Potential (GWP) values considered",
were taken from the Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) published by the IPCC and the Australian,
"National Greenhouse Accounts Factors published by the Department of Climate Change, Energy, the",
Environment and Water in 2024.,
"Scope 1 and 2 emissions are measured by either internal or external data sources, factoring in the",
uncertainty measurement and data quality.,

Changes to the measurement of emissions from FY24
"In addition to the emissions sources captured in FY24, the following emissions sources were included"
in FY25:

"•  Scope 1, Transport fuel emissions: Fuel consumption from expense claims."
