Scope 3 emissions
"Quantifying indirect (Scope 3) emissions across our value chain remains a complex task, given the number of"
contributing sources and the variability of available data. Scope 3 emissions include all indirect greenhouse gas
"emissions that occur across Endeavour’s value chain, excluding those from owned or directly controlled sources."
Since F23 we have progressively continued to develop an indicative inventory of Scope 3 emissions using the
GHG Protocol in preparation for future reporting requirements.
"By analysing available data and assessing our ability to influence outcomes in each area, we identified six material"
"categories for calculation and future disclosure. In F26, we plan to disclose our baseline Scope 3 inventory and"
targets based off F25 data.

Electronic Vehicle (EV) charging
"In F25, we completed installation of our"
Electronic Vehicle (EV) charging station at
Gepps Cross Hotel in Adelaide. This site
takes the number of EV charging stations
"across our network to eleven, delivering a"
reliable and fast charging experience for our
customers while they dine or shop with us.
Two further installations are planned for
F26 as we continue to trial initiatives to
help reduce our Scope 3 emissions.

Other information
Management and the Directors of Endeavour are responsible for the other information. The other information comprises
"other Sustainability information included in the Corporate Reports, but does not include the Subject Matter Information"
and our assurance report thereon. Our limited assurance conclusion does not cover the other information and we do not
express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
"In connection with our assurance engagement on the Subject Matter Information, our responsibility is to read the other"
"information identified above and, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with"
"the Subject Matter Information or our knowledge obtained in the assurance engagement, or otherwise appears to be"
"materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude there is a material misstatement of this"
"other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard."
Inherent Limitations
"Because of the inherent limitations of an assurance engagement, together with the inherent limitations of any system of"
"internal control there is an unavoidable risk that fraud, error, non-compliance with laws and regulations or misstatements"
in the Subject Matter Information may occur and not be detected.
Emissions quantification is subject to inherent uncertainty because incomplete scientific knowledge has been used to
determine emissions factors and the values needed to combine emissions due to different gases. We specifically note
that Endeavour has used estimates or extrapolated underlying information to calculate certain amounts included within
Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas and energy information.
"Additionally, non-financial data may be subject to more inherent limitations than financial data, given both its nature"
"and the methods used for determining, calculating and sampling or estimating such data."
Restricted use
The Reporting Criteria used for this engagement was designed for the specific purpose of reporting on the Subject
"Matter Information presented in the Corporate Reports, as a result, the Subject Matter Information may not be suitable"
for another purpose.
This report has been prepared for use by the Directors of Endeavour for the purpose of providing assurance over the
Subject Matter Information presented in the Corporate Reports. We disclaim any assumption of responsibility for any
reliance on this report to any person other than Directors of Endeavour or for any purpose other than that for which
it was prepared.
Matters relating to electronic presentation of information
It is our understanding that Endeavour may publish a copy of our report on their website. We do not accept responsibility
for the electronic presentation of our report on the Endeavour website. The security and controls over information on
the website is not evaluated or addressed by the independent assurance practitioner. The examination of the controls
over the electronic presentation of this report on Endeavour’s website is beyond the scope of this engagement.

Glossary,
TERM,MEANING
Carbon dioxide equivalent,A standard measure used to compare the emissions from various greenhouse gases
(CO2e),based on their global warming potential.
EBIT,Earnings Before Interest and Tax – total earnings before provisions are deducted.
,This measures a company’s performance and is often used in preference to net profit
,as it excludes the effects of borrowings and tax benefits and adjustments.
Forest Stewardship Council,"FSC is an independent, not-for-profit organisation which promotes responsible"
(FSC),management of the world’s forests. Refer to fsc.org or fscaustralia.org.au.
MWh,A megawatt hour is a measure of electrical energy equivalent to a power
,"consumption of 1,000 kilowatts for one hour."
National Greenhouse and,NGER establishes a national framework for Australian corporations to report
Energy Reporting Act 2007,"greenhouse gas emissions, reductions, removals and offsets, and energy consumption"
(NGER),and production. Refer to climatechange.gov.au/reporting/publications.
Scope 1 emissions,Direct greenhouse gas emissions from sources owned or controlled by the
,"Company, such as combustion facilities (e.g. generators) and combustion of fuels"
,in Company-owned or Company-controlled transport (e.g. cars and trucks).
Scope 2 emissions,"Indirect greenhouse gas emissions from the generation of purchased electricity,"
,"heat, cooling or steam. Purchased electricity is defined as electricity that is bought"
,or otherwise brought into the organisational boundary of the entity.
Scope 3 emissions,Other indirect greenhouse gas emissions that are a consequence of a company’s
,"activities, but that arise from sources that other entities own or control. Scope 3, like"
,"Scope 2, is a category of indirect emissions and covers all other indirect emissions"
,"from sources that are not owned or controlled by a company, but that occur as a"
,result of its activities. Examples include emissions from waste disposal to landfill.
Sustainable Development Goals,17 global goals set by the United Nations in 2015 to define global sustainable
(SDGs),development priorities and aspirations for the planet.
Total Recordable Injury (TRI),"A Total Recordable Injury (TRI) is the sum of the total number of employee fatalities,"
and Total Recordable Injury,"lost time injuries, restricted work injuries or medical treatment injuries within a"
Frequency Rate (TRIFR),given period.
,The formula for Total Recordable Injury Frequency Rate (TRIFR) is the addition of the
,"number of fatalities, lost time injuries, restricted work injuries and medical treatment"
,injuries in a 12-month period divided by hours worked in a 12-month period multiplied
,"by 1,000,000."
