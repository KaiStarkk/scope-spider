2020 
– 2021
Setting the 
strategyThe Group launched our 2025 Sustainability Plan (2025 Plan), marking a step-change in 
our approach through 14 goals across People, Planet and Product. To enable execution we 
appointed our first Chief Sustainability Officer , and established accountability for delivery 
directly with the Group Executive Committee.
2022
Driving 
executionWith strategy and governance in place, we operationalised delivery across the entire business: 
Activating a Group-wide transformation program by embedding the 2025 Plan into our 
business priorities, driving delivery across our 14 goals. 
Investing in innovation by leveraging our business units including W360 (waste, water, 
energy, packaging), W23 (venture capital), and Healthylife (health and wellness).
Benchmarking our performance  against leading global and national frameworks 
– including the Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation, Science-based Target Initiative, 
Reconciliation Australia and KnowTheChain – to drive best practice.
2025
Demonstrating 
resilienceOver these five years, our dynamic operating environment presented a non-linear path, 
requiring us to: 
Adapt our approach  to significant economic shifts, technological advancements, 
and evolving regulatory and societal expectations.
Manage disruptions , including leading through the REDcycle collapse, remediating our first 
modern slavery case, addressing heightened scrutiny on greenwashing, and constructively 
engaging with growing activism.
Collaborate with the industry  on joint solutions to shared challenges.2023  
– 2025
Accelerating 
impactWith execution ongoing, we accelerated our impact:
Advocating for policy change by engaging on critical industry issues including 
the Soft  Plastics Taskforce, national plastic regulation, and decarbonisation.
Forging strategic partnerships with OzHarvest, the Climate Leaders Coalition, and the 
Consumer Goods Forum, Healthy Food Partnership to amplify collective environmental 
and social outcomes.
Engaging our suppliers by launching Trade Partner Sustainability Councils to build shared 
capability and drive alignment with our goals within our supply chain.A five-year journey 
towards a better tomorrowOur 2025 Sustainability Plan:
Woolworths Group’s approach to sustainability is anchored in our Group purpose: to create 
better experiences together for a better tomorrow. Since launching a comprehensive strategy

to meet our 100% renewable electricity ambition 
by the end of 2025 as we continue to reduce our 
scope 1 & 2 emissions through energy efficiency and 
transport decarbonisation. With scope  3 comprising 
the majority of our emissions, we have more to do to 
navigate the shared challenge of addressing this with 
our partners. We also diverted 84% of food waste from 
landfill donating millions of meals to people in need.

Addressing climate 
and nature together
Why it matters to us
Woolworths Group and its suppliers rely on a healthy planet to meet customer needs. 
Climate  change and nature loss are consistently recognised as significant global risks 1, 
with these challenges projected to place increasing pressure on food production. This could 
potentially impact the Group’s supply chains, product availability and affordability. In F25 alone, 
the Group experienced 98 days of unplanned disruption to its operations and supply chains due 
to weather -related events. The Group’s resilience plans, as well as government partnerships on 
emergency response planning and disruption management, helped to minimise these impacts. 
As a food retailer, the Group’s focus is on supporting sustainable food systems through climate 
and nature -focused actions. 
What we’ve learnt
We’ve reduced direct emissions and are building 
resilience across our network. However, tackling 
supply chain emissions requires a collective effort 
where our suppliers, industry and government all play 
a role in decarbonisation. Progress depends on this 
cross -sector collaboration, operational adaptability, 
and responsiveness to navigate market volatility, 
shifting standards and evolving regulations effectively.

What our 2025 Plan set out to do
Our journey began with an ambition for a net positive 
future. We have since refined this to aim for net zero 
emissions across our value chain by 2050, aligning with 
a 1.5°C pathway. In F24, we updated and strengthened 
our emission reduction targets which are validated by 
the Science-Based Target Initiative (SBTi) (for more 
details see our 2025 Annual Report ). We continue to 
partner with our suppliers and the agriculture industry 
to foster better stewardship of natural resources and 
maintain high sourcing standards.Our performanceGoals 1, 3 and 438
Scope 3 emissions are indirect emissions from the Group’s upstream and downstream 
value chain. For the Group’s F23 base year, approximately 50% of these emissions are 
from forest, land and agriculture (FLAG) sources generated pre -farmgate. The remaining 
50% are from energy and industrial sources such as post -farmgate electricity and gas, 
services, packaging, transport, and downstream waste.

Base year scope 3 inventory (50%) Base year scope 3 inventory (50%)Understanding emissions and opportunity for impact
Woolworths Group’s scope 1 and 2 emissions make up 4% of the total emissions across its end-to-end value chain. 
The Group’s scope 3 emissions are approximately 23 times greater than scope 1 and 2, making up 96% of the emissions 
in the end-to-end value chain. Managing scope 3 emissions is complex, representing emissions from a variety of 
sources – the largest being agriculture, energy and transport.
Woolworths Group’s primary climate disclosures for F25, including information on 
our governance, strategy, risk management, metrics and targets, are presented

Scope 1 and 2 emissions are directly within the Group’s operational control. Material 
scope 1 emissions sources include fugitive synthetic refrigerants, transport fuel for fleet 
cars and home delivery trucks, and natural gas. Scope 2 emissions form the largest part 
of the Group’s operational footprint, primarily from the electricity used across the store 
network, distribution centres and offices.
