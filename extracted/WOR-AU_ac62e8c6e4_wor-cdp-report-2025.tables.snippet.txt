Our aspiration to derive 75% of our revenue from sustainability-related work by 2026 is dependent on market conditions. Achieving our net zero Scope 1 and Scope 2
"target has several uncertainties, including the ability to procure zero-emissions electricity, heating and cooling, the accessibility of zero-emission vehicles and"
"charging infrastructure, and the ability to source high-quality accredited carbon credits for our residual emissions. We are managing these uncertainties by monitoring"
"and choosing fully renewable energy procurement options, fully electrified buildings and electric vehicles in the countries we operate in. Where available, we work"
"closely with local teams to implement these initiatives. We expect that sourcing these options will become more accessible as we get closer to 2030, however, it is"
likely we will not be able to remove all of our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. We plan to offset these residual emissions using high quality carbon credits to achieve
net zero Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions by 2030.
(5.2.11) Description of progress against transition plan disclosed in current or previous reporting period
"In FY2025, our sustainability-related aggregated revenue was $7.3 billion up from $6.04 billion at 30 June 2024. In FY2024 we completed our initial $100m strategic"
"investment in organic growth, including carbon capture and storage, lower carbon hydrogen, battery materials and lower carbon fuels. We have extended this"
investment by deploying around $30m in FY2025 on similar investments because accretive opportunities continue to be available for further growth. We're on track to
"meet our Scope 1 & Scope 2 net zero targets, reducing our emissions by 19% from FY24 and by 73% from our FY2020 baseline."

(6.1.2) Provide the rationale for the choice of consolidation approach
"Worley applies the operational control approach, as defined by the GHG Protocol Corporate Reporting and Accounting Standard, to our environmental reporting. This"
"approach ensures we account for 100% of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions in all locations, including subsidiaries and joint ventures where we have full authority to"
introduce and implement our operating policies. We do not include Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from construction sites where we do not hold the operating
"license, even if we have day-to-day oversight and control of activities on the construction site. For locations under partial control during the financial year, emissions"
are calculated for the period we had control. We evaluated the financial control and equity share approaches and determined that operational control provides the
most consistent and practical framework for our services-based business model. Worley’s services and revenues can involve a variety of commercial and contractual
"arrangements, so the operational control approach for our environmental reporting provides consistency across these varied relationships and best meets our"
business activities. We also report relevant Scope 3 emissions to capture our broader climate footprint. Our boundary approach is reviewed annually to ensure

GHG emissions from our people traveling between their homes and workplaces. This also includes emissions from our people teleworking. We’ve chosen to account
"for these GHG emissions because we estimate that more than half of all hours our people worked are from home. We use de-identified data from our people system,"

"Scope 1 GHG emissions are calculated using methods and emission factors appropriate to each source and location, including: • GHG emissions from the"
combustion of fossil fuels for energy: the GHG emissions are calculated by multiplying the quantity of fuel consumed by the appropriate emission factor for the fuel in
the location consumed. • GHG emissions from leakage of refrigerants: the GHG emissions are calculated by multiplying the quantity of refrigerant used to refill or top
"up the system by the appropriate emission factor for the refrigerant type. If actual usage data is not available, it is estimated or accrued. For energy consumption in"
"offices, we estimate usage based on the average use per floor space for other offices in the same region with similar climate conditions. For energy consumption in"
"vehicles, where data is available on distance traveled, we apply an average factor of liters per kilometer to estimate fuel used. Where data is available on fuel cost,"
"we apply an average factor of cost per liter in the local currency to estimate fuel used. For refrigerant leakage, we estimate based on industry average leakage rates"
"for similar types of systems and equipment. In FY2025, we calculated approximately 85 percent of our Scope 1 GHG emissions using actual data and 15 percent"

We report Scope 2 emissions using both location-based and market-based methods as recommended by the GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance. • Market-based
"reporting: where we directly purchase renewable energy, including bundled energy with attributes, we use emission factors from the contractual agreement in place."

=== Table 27 (page 137) ===
"Where grid electricity is supplied to our locations and we purchase unbundled renewable energy certificates (RECs) or equivalent, we use emission factors"
"appropriate to the energy type and location. We then apply the RECs, purchased in line with the Scope 2 market-based accounting approach from the GHG Protocol,"
"to the appropriate energy use to support our renewable energy claim. For the remaining electricity consumption, we apply residual mix emission factors to calculate"
"Scope 2 market-based GHG emissions. Where residual mix emission factors are not available, we apply location-based factors. • Location-based: we use emission"
factors based on the average emissions intensity of grids on which energy consumption occurs to calculate gross Scope 2 emissions. Our locations record the supply
of third-party generated energy to our locations throughout the year based on supplier or landlord invoices or meter data. The GHG emissions are calculated by
"multiplying the quantity of energy supplied by the appropriate emission factor for the energy type and location. If actual usage data is not available, it is estimated or"
"accrued. For energy usage (including purchased electricity, heating and cooling) for offices, we estimate usage based on the average usage per floor space for other"
"offices in the same region with similar climate conditions. In FY2025, we calculated approximately 89 percent of our Scope 2 emissions using actual data, and 11"

"Upstream (cradle-to-gate) GHG emissions of our purchased goods and services, including corporate procurement, information technology (IT) procurement, and"
procurement we do for our customers during projects where we have operational control. We estimate GHG emissions for purchased goods and services using the
"spend-based method, and extrapolation. Procurement data is collected from countries where we operate. The data is categorized, and GHG emissions are calculated"
using spend-based emission factors from Comprehensive Environmental Data Archive (CEDA) 2024. CEDA assumes procurement is based in the United States in
"2022. To estimate the FY2025 GHG emissions, we adjust factors by the inflation rate, currency conversion and power purchasing parity percentages. Where"
"procurement data is not available, data is extrapolated by assuming the type of items procured is the same as the previous period and using a ratio of either the"
"number of people or procurement spend. We procure a significant amount of goods and services on behalf of customers, over which we have limited control. To"
"adjust for this, we multiply the total GHG emissions for purchased goods and services by the proportion of spend on our paper for which we had operational control."
"For this reporting period, we estimate 90 percent. Considerable time is required to collect data and calculate Scope 3 emissions. As such, our FY2025 Scope 3,"
Category 1 emissions estimates use data from 1 February 2024 to 31 January 2025. The spend-based method of calculating GHG emissions from purchased goods
and services is generally the least specific and accurate calculation method available. We’re working to improve our supply chain data to enable us to estimate
"emissions using more accurate and specific methods such as the supplier specific, average-data and hybrid methods. In FY2025, we estimated 67 percent of our"
emissions for this category using the spend-based method and 33 percent by extrapolation.

Select from:
☑ Customer base is too large and diverse to accurately track emissions to the customer level
(7.27.2) Please explain what would help you overcome these challenges
Allocation by customer is generally not completed because emissions are only quantified and reported for Worley Group by location and generally not recorded in
detail for client-specific project work. We recognize that allocation adds uncertainty to emissions estimates and can result in inaccuracies when an activity or facility
produces a wide variety of products that differ significantly in their GHG contribution. It is important to note that we are able to capture data for individual clients if it is
"included as part of the overall service to be provided. It would help to receive clarification from our clients on how much they value this information, so that we can"
work with them to develop solutions.

"Our Scope 1 & 2 emissions come primarily from electricity and natural gas usage in our buildings, and fuel used in our vehicles. We are progressively reducing the"
"emissions of our electricity usage by procuring renewable energy in our locations. We are reducing overall energy usage, and therefore our emissions, by choosing"
"more energy-efficient buildings to lease. We're also reducing the emissions of our vehicle fleet by transitioning to hybrid and electric vehicles. In the reporting year, we"
have reduced our Scope 1 & 2 emissions by 19% compared to the previous year. This reduction has come mostly from an increase in renewable energy
procurement.
