Disclaimer
This report contains general background information about the Group’s activities current

which QBE has lodged with the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). Copies of those 
lodgements are available from either the ASX website at www.asx.com.au or QBE’s 
website at www.qbe.com. The information is supplied in summary form and is therefore not 
necessarily complete. It is not intended to be and should not be relied upon as advice to 
investors or potential investors, and does not take into account the investment objectives, 
financial situation or needs of any particular investor. Prior to making a decision in relation 
to QBE’s securities, products or services, investors, potential investors and customers 
must undertake their own due diligence as to the merits and risks associated with that 
decision, which includes obtaining independent financial, legal and tax advice on their

Forward-looking statements
This report may contain forward-looking statements. The words “anticipate”, “believe”, 
“expect”, “project”, “forecast”, “estimate”, “likely”, “intend”, “should”, “could”, “may”, 
“target”, “plan”, “outlook”, “ambition” and other similar expressions are intended to identify 
forward -looking statements. Indications of, and guidance on, future carbon emissions, 
earnings and financial position and performance are also forward-looking statements. 
Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve 
known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond 
the control of QBE that may cause actual results to differ materially from those either 
expressed or  implied in such statements. There can be no assurance that actual outcomes 
will not differ materially from these statements. You are cautioned not to place undue 
reliance on  forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements only speak 
as of the date of this report and QBE assumes no obligation to update such information.
Any forward-looking statements in respect of earnings and financial position 
and performance assume ex-cat and catastrophe claims do not exceed the allowance 
in our business plans, no changes in premium rates in excess of our business plans, 
no significant change in equity markets and interest rates, no major movement in budgeted 
foreign exchange rates, recoveries from our reinsurance panel, no unplanned asset sales,  
no substantial change in regulation, and no material change to key inflation and economic 
growth forecasts; in each case, materially from the expectations described in this report. 
Should one or more of these assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ.
Climate-related statements
This report contains certain climate-related statements, including in relation to 
climate -related risks and opportunities, climate-related goals and ambitions, climate 
scenarios, emissions reduction pathways and climate projections. These climate -related 
statements are subject to uncertainties, limitations, risks, challenges, and assumptions 
associated with climate-related information, and may be dependent on many factors 
that are not fully within our control. These factors include progress of individuals, 
businesses and economies to transition, governmental action, availability and reliability 
of data, and availability of solutions and technologies that enable greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction and removal. The information in this report should be read in 
conjunction with  the qualifications and guidance included in this report as well as 
the 2024  Sustainability Report and Data Book available at QBE’s website.Contents
