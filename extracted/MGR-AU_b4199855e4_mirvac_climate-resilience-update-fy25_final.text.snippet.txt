Climate resilience update
We continue to integrate climate resilience across strategy, risk management, and capital 
allocation. In FY25, we:
 –released our Net Positive Carbon by 2030 progress update
 –submitted emissions targets to the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi)
 –hosted an internal executive nature workshop to deepen understanding of biodiversity-related 
risks and opportunities, and agree our approach to the work ahead.
We also advanced scenario planning aligned to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC) science, ensuring our strategy is resilient under various climate trajectories—from 
disorderly transitions to a collective shift to a low-carbon economy.
Governance and strategy
Our governance structure ensures our climate risks are actively managed. The Board oversees 
our sustainability strategy and risk appetite, while the ELT is accountable for implementation. 
Climate-related KPIs are embedded in executive remuneration, and progress is reviewed 
quarterly. Our Audit, Risk and Compliance Committee and HSE&S Committee provide further 
oversight. You can view our corporate governance framework in our Corporate Governance 
Statement here and further information on the Board’s activities in this area during FY25 are 
outlined on page 46 of our annual report, available here.
We continue to integrate climate risk into our enterprise risk management framework, identifying both transition and physical risks. 
The electrification of our assets, our procurement of lower carbon materials, and scenario analysis aligned with a 2°C pathway 
are key components of our strategy. In FY22, we followed the recommended Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD) process, utilising science from the IPCC AR6 reports, to develop three climate-related scenarios that reflect three different 
levels of potential warming: Tense connections (>2.5°), Clever transitions (2.0-2.5°), and Collective choices (<1.5-2.0°).
You can read more about each of these scenarios on page 8 of our previous Building Climate Resilience report here.
TENSE CONNECTIONS  
(>2.5 DEGREES)

chains; global markets; international trade 
and relations; regional economic impacts; 
population changes.CLEVER TRANSITIONS 
(2.0-2.5 DEGREES)
Key uncertainties the scenario tests:

readiness; leaps of faith in new 
technologies; policy support for transition; 
disorderly or delayed transitions.COLLECTIVE CHOICES

Key uncertainties the scenario tests: 
customer and societal preferences; the 
value of wellbeing; carbon pricing level;

Climate-related risks & opportunities
We are committed to managing climate-related opportunities and risks to our business, while contributing to a more sustainable future. Our top ten 
climate-related risks and opportunities over short-, medium- and long-term timelines align with our business planning and capital allocation plans 
(short-term: one to two years; medium-term: five years; long-term: 10+ years).

Metrics, targets and next steps
Since launching This Changes Everything in 2014, we have tracked emissions and water 
intensity, and emissions reduction.
To support our long-term goals, we set sustainability targets aligned with our ESG strategy. 
Accountabilities are shared across all divisions, and the Group scorecard is reviewed quarterly 
by the HSE&S Committee, ELT, and Board. More detail can be found on page 56 of our 
annual report available here.
As climate disclosure standards evolve, we are getting ready to meet Australia’s new requirements.  
With years of experience managing climate risks and opportunities, we are committed to advancing  
decarbonisation and building resilience across the sector.

1. From FY23 the addition of five Mirvac Wholesale Office Fund (MWOF) assets resulted in an increase to Scope 1, 
emissions, electricity and water consumed.
2. Mirvac offsets 100 more tonnes of Scope 1 and Scope 2 carbon emissions than we emit, meeting our Net Positive 
in Scope 1 and 2 Carbon Emissions by 2030 target.
