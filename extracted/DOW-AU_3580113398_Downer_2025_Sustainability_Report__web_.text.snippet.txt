The People Strategy is a driver of 
performance, resilience, and 
differentiation — a roadmap that 
will create the workplace 
environment where high-
performing teams can deliver with 
purpose, consistency, and 
efficiency.
Health, safety and 
wellbeing: Visible 
leadership focus driving 
improved performance
The Group Health and Safety 
Strateg ic Plan builds on our strong 
Zero Harm c ulture and 
commitment to continuous 
improvement — aligning safety 
with high performance to create 
an environment where people are 
encouraged to speak up, adapt, 
and continuously improve.
The Group Health and Safety 
Strategic Plan FY25-27 is 
structured around five priorities — 
leadership engagement, critical 
risk management, contractor 
alignment, targeted wellbeing 
programs, and strengthened 
onboarding — and aims to deliver 
consistent, measurable 
improvements across all levels of 
the business.
It ultimately aims to support a 
high-performing environment, 
where empowered teams learn 
from experiences, respond to 
challenges with agility, and are 
supported to deliver long-term 
value for our customers and 
communities.
A core focus of the strategy in 
FY25 was to continue to enhance 
our Critical Risk Management 
Framework through the 
introduction of the Visible 
Leadership and Critical Control 
Improvement program. This 
program represents a change in emphasis — focusing on 
improving safety through actively 
listening to frontline experience, 
testing critical control 
performance under real-world 
conditions, and continuously 
improving how we manage risks in 
the field. Throughout FY25, 
Downer’s senior, middle and 
frontline leaders undertook more 
than 67,000 field safety 
engagements resulting in both 
immediate in-field safety 
improvements as well as the 
development of 12 critical control 
improvement projects for 
implementation across the 
business. 
Pleasingly, Downer’s lagging 
indicators improved in FY25. Lost 
Time Injury Frequency Rate was 
below our target of <0.90 at 0.83, 
and lower than the FY24 result of 
0.88, while Total Recordable Injury 
Frequency Rate was below the 
target of <3.00 at 2.04, and also 
lower than our FY24 result of 2.54. 
Environment and climate 
change: Continued 
emissions reduction
Downer is committed to reducing 
the impact of our operations on 
the environment and articulating 
the impact of climate change on 
our business to stakeholders. 
In FY25, we prepared our second 
Climate Statement in alignment 
with the Aotearoa New Zealand 
Climate Standards (NZ CS), 
providing a preliminary 
assessment of climate-related 
risks and opportunities and 
potential implications for our 
business. This statement is 
included in full within the FY25 
Annual Report — released 
concurrently with this 
Sustainability Report — covering 
governance, strategy, risk management, and targets and 
metrics.
Demonstrating progress beyond 
policy, the report features 
examples of how 
decarbonisation, climate 
resilience and adaptation are 
being implemented — 
demonstrating how Downer is 
delivering low-carbon 
infrastructure, improving asset 
durability, and supporting our 
customers through the energy 
transition. The inclusion of our 
Climate Statement in the Annual 
Report supports Downer's 
preparation for the upcoming 
Australian Sustainability Reporting 
Standards, which take effect for 
Downer in FY26.
Minimising and effectively 
managing our environmental 
impacts enables Downer to not 
only meet our compliance 
obligations, but also maintain our 
social licence, sustain and build 
relationships, manage risks and 
opportunities, and deliver 
efficiencies. 
In FY25, Downer’s operational 
emissio ns — total Scope 1 and 2 
(market based) — was 302,151  
tCO2-e, which is a (7.7)%  decrease  
from FY24.  Downer executed a 
number of planned 
decarbonisation initiatives this 
year, including plant upgrades 
and the electrification of key plant 
assets, asphalt plant upgrades 
and efficiencies, and fleet removal 
and conversion.
Downer also successfully 
maintained its Group-wide target 
of zero environmental 
prosecutions and zero significant 
environmental incidents in FY25.Overview Environment and Climate Change Health, Safety and Wellbeing People Governance

Sustainability governance
Downer ’s corporate governance 
framework provides the platform for 
the identification and management 
of key risks, including those relating 
to sustainability, across the business. 
The Downer  Board has oversight on 
sustainability (including climate 
change) across Downer  and has 
established a number of 
committees to assist it in effectively 
and efficiently executing its 
responsibilities. For more detail on 
each Board committee, members, 
and purpose, refer to Downer ’s 
Corporate Governance Statement 
in the 2025  Annual Report.
The Board considers sustainability 
risks and opportunities in the 
following committees, forums , and 
processes to inform its governance 
approach: 
Zero Harm Committee: The primary 
committee where sustainability 
related matters are discussed. This 
includes health and safety 
management, controls and 
performance, and environment 
(including climate change) reporting 
and performance. 
Audit and Risk Committee: Assists 
the Board in overseeing Downer ’s 
enterprise risk profile, the 
effectiveness of internal control 
systems, and the Risk Management 
Framework. This includes 
governance over Downer’s 
integrated management system, 
which encompasses the Enterprise 
Risk Management Framework, The 
Downer Standard, and the Delivery 
Governance Management system. 
These frameworks support a 
consistent and structured approach 
to managing risk, compliance, and 
project delivery across the business 
(see Governance and risk 
management on page 60 for 
further detail).  The Committee also 
has oversight of Downer's 
compliance with applicable legal 
and regulatory obligat ions, 
including those related to 
sustainability. Additionally, the 
Committee oversees climate-
related risks and opportunities, with 
a particular focus on governing the financial implications of climate 
change, and associated reporting 
requirements. 
People and Culture Committee : 
Responsible for settin g annual 
targets linked to Downer’s 
Short-Term Incentive scheme, 
cover ing areas such as 
sustainability, including health and 
safety, e nvironmental compliance, 
climate change and 
decarbonisation, and employee 
engagement. The People and 
Culture Committee also receives 
annual reports from management 
on Downer ’s sustainability 
performance, which inform the 
application of Downer ’s 
Remuneration Policy for 
sustainability linked remuneration. 
For more information refer to the 
2025  Annual Report .
Executive Leadership Team Forums
Sustainability is considered in 
various periodic Executive 
Leadership Team forums, including 
the monthly meeting attended by 
the Group Chief Executive Officer 
(CEO), Group Chief Financial Officer 
(CFO), Group General Counsel & 
Company Secretary, Group Chief 
People Officer (CPO), Group Chief 
Risk Officer (CRO), the Chief 
Operating Officers (COOs) of each 
Business Unit and Group Functional 
Leads (including the Group 
Executive General Manager 
Sustainability and Environment, and 
Group Executive General Manager 
Zero Harm). 
In addition, Quarterly Business 
Reviews were held in FY25  between 
the CEO, CFO, CRO, Group 
Functional Leads, and Business Unit 
Leads including COOs and their 
Operational and Functional Leads. 
Sustainability performance was 
routinely reviewed in these forums.Executive reporting to Board
Downer’s Executive also reports 
sustainability-related information to 
the Board, through Downer's 
monthly Group Performance Report 
process. The Board receives 
monthly reporting on strategic 
initiatives and performance for key 
sustainability metrics,  including:  
nClimate-related metrics (for 
example, greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions performance, and 
climate-related risks and 
opportunities)
nEnvironmental compliance
nHealth and safety statistics
nEmployee statistics.
Credibility in sustainability 
reporting
Downer recognises that 
transparency in sustainability 
reporting is essential to maintaining 
trust with stakeholders. To manage 
the risk of misinterpretation or 
overstated claims, sometimes 
referred to as greenwashing, internal 
controls are applied to relevant 
disclosures, and selected 
sustainability metrics are subject to 
external assurance or review to help 
support their accuracy and 
reliability.Overview Environment and Climate Change Health, Safety and Wellbeing People Governance

Materiality  assessment
Downer ’s materiality assessment is 
grounded in engagement with both 
internal and external stakeholders, 
consistent with the Global Reporting 
Initiative (GRI) 2: General Disclosures 
2021, including GRI 3: Material Topics 
2021 and GRI 2-29 on stakeholder 
engagement. Stakeholders were 
identified based on their relevance 
to Downer’s value chain, decision-
making influence, and potential to 
be impacted by or influence 
sustainability issues. Input from stakeholders has 
provided a foundation for our 
materiality assessment, conducted 
by an independent third party. 
Engagement was undertaken via 
surveys and interviews, designed to 
capture diverse views on Downer 's 
sustainability impacts, risks, and 
opportunities. Respondents included 
employees, investors, customers, 
suppliers, and community and 
industry partners. 
We adopted the concept of double 
materiality by assessing materiality 
from two perspectives:nImpact of Downer  on the 
economy, environment and 
people (including their human 
rights)
nQualitatively considered the 
impact of our sustainability-
related risks and opportunities 
on Downer ’s business model, 
strategy, and cash flows .
Downer ’s most recent formal materiality assessment was conducted in 2023 and followed a five-phase process:
nPhase 1 Longlist development: 
Downer  identified a longlist of 
sustainability topics through 
thematic analysis, considering 
organisational context, ESG 
standards, peer benchmarking, 
previous insights, and actual and 
potential sustainability impacts.nPhase 2 Stakeholder 
engagement:  Input was 
gathered through surveys and 
qualitative interviews to 
understand perceived impacts 
and business relevance.
nPhase 3 Analysis and insights: 
Responses were analysed to 
rank topics by stakeholder 
significance and explore 
potential financial materiality.nPhase 4 Prioritisation and 
validation: A cross-functional 
internal workshop reviewed 
findings and aligned on 
thresholds for prioritisation.
nPhase 5 Finalisation: The results 
were synthesised into a 
validated materiality matrix and 
a list of prioritised ESG topics.
