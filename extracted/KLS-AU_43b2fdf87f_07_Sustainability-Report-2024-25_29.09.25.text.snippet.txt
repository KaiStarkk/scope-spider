Kelsian Group 2024/2025 Sustainability Report        11
           
Kelsian is committed to supporting our customers and partners to 
achieve their emissions reduction targets by delivering smart, low and zero emission transport solutions that reduce operational emissions and enhance liveability in the communities we serve. As governments, customers and investors increasingly focus on decarbonisation, we are helping to accelerate this shift through practical investments, service innovation and strategic collaboration.
Globally, the transport sector accounts for around 27% of all energy 
use, and 64% of total oil consumption.
3 On the emissions front, the 
transport sector accounts for 23% of global carbon emissions.4  
Despite the challenge, decarbonising the transport sector presents one of the greatest opportunities for climate action. Through targeted investment in technology and partnerships with transport authorities, Kelsian continues to enable the shift from high-emission transport modes to more sustainable alternatives.
Mode shift plays a central role in reducing emissions and pollution, 
while also delivering broader social and economic benefits including reduced road congestion and increased connectivity. Kelsian supports this shift by encouraging people to move from private cars to shared transport options such as buses and ferries. Our contribution is made possible through:
• Investment in Zero Emissions Buses (ZEBs) and Infrastructure:  
As of 30 June 2025, our fleet included 204 ZEBs and one of the largest electrified bus depots in Australia at Leichhardt, Sydney. 
3  Inter national Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD).
4 IPC C Sixth Assessment Report.
5 State o f Climate Action 2021, Climateworks Centre.• Improving the Passenger Experience: Our zero emission buses offer a smoother, quieter ride, with upgraded interiors including improved seating and onboard USB charging.
• Policy Collaboration: We work closely with government partners to align services with climate targets, secure funding for infrastructure upgrades, and shape forward-looking transport strategies.
• Public Awareness Campaigns: Initiatives have helped promote  
the environmental benefits of public transport and influence commuter behaviour.
• Service Frequency and Reliability: While operations vary across regions, high-frequency, on-time services are key to making public transport a convenient alternative to car travel.
• Digital Innovation: Real-time tracking apps and tap-and-go payment options improve convenience and build trust in service reliability.
Kelsian has set a target to reduce the Scope 1 carbon intensity of our Australian public bus fleet by at least 50% by 2035, with a pathway  
to net zero by 2050. While we have not set a Group-wide Scope 1  
reduction target, we continue to seek opportunities that balance emissions reduction with operational and commercial value.
Through continued investment, innovation and collaboration, Kelsian  
is proud to work with our government clients and customers to support 
the broader decarbonisation of transport systems and create more sustainable, connected communities.
Public Transport Sector5
Electric vehicles, and policy to support their uptake, needs to sit within a broader emissions reduction strategy for the transport sector. This includes shifting people onto more efficient and lower emission modes of transport such as shared mobility services in lower emissions vehicles, walking and cycling.
