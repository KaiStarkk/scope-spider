These are the factors which Nine considers for the 
sustainable growth of our business; environmentally,  socially and through good governance. 
This year, Nine has focused intensely on aligning our  
cultural evolution directly with the ambitious Nine2028 transformation program.
We recognise the integral role that Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) factors play in driving long-term value for our 
stakeholders. Our commitment to sustainability and ethical practices is an integral part of our business strategy, operations, and culture. This year, we have made good progress in advancing our ESG initiatives, focused on understanding our environmental footprint and climate-related risks and opportunities, fostering a diverse and inclusive workplace, and ensuring transparent and accountable governance. As we continue to evolve, we are dedicated to making a positive impact on society, the environment,  and the economy, while aligning our goals with the expectations of our customers, investors, and communities.
Governance Structure
The Nine Board has ultimate responsibility for setting and overseeing the Group's ESG strategy and the risk management approach. ESG risks are considered by the Board as part of their overall risk oversight.
The Board’s Charter specifies that the Board oversees ESG 
policy and strategy, and the identification of Groupwide risks and opportunities. The Board delegates performance of this responsibility to the Audit & Risk Management Committee (“ARC”) with the support of various teams throughout the organisation. Risks are reported to the ARC each quarter,  which includes ESG risks and opportunities where relevant,  and the risk report is discussed as a recurring meeting agenda item each quarter.
The framework of Nine’s ESG governance structure, roles and 
responsibilities is shown below. This highlights the relationship between the Board structure, executive committees and supporting governance working groups. This diagram focuses on governance in relation to ESG only and therefore does not depict the Group’s complete governance structure.Environment, Social

Climate-related procedures and controls
Management’s oversight of the Group’s risks and 
opportunities is supported by procedures and controls relating to the identification of risks and opportunities and the monitoring of performance in managing those risks, including the measurement of Greenhouse Gas (“GHG”) emissions. These controls form part of the Group’s risk management processes and are integrated throughout the Group’s business functions.
Executive management plays a key role in implementing 
and monitoring the effectiveness of governance processes, procedures and controls, including oversight  of all key activities conducted in the business, development of strategies and tracking progress against these strategies. Management holds responsibility for daily implementation of governance frameworks and controls  to support compliance and stakeholder communications.
Climate-related skills and experience
The Board assesses the skills and experience of Directors on an annual basis, with this assessment informing the Board Skills Matrix as disclosed in Section 2.3 of the Corporate Governance Statement 2025. This matrix identifies current and desired skills of Directors, considering the Group's strategy and external environment, and is crucial for Board and Committee effectiveness.
While the Board has significant experience in oversight  
of strategy in response to climate-related risks and opportunities, with the introduction of Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards (“ASRS”) in FY26,  the Board attended training and development sessions  to support the Board in assessing the underlying factors for climate-related risks and opportunities, as well as the effect that they may have on the Group and its value chain.
The training and development sessions attended by the 
Board involved external experts presenting to the Board on key climate-related topics, including the overarching governance and responsibilities of the Board, climate-related risks and opportunities and scenario analysis,  GHG emissions, and science-based targets.
Strategy and Target Setting
The Board is responsible for overall ESG leadership, which includes setting and overseeing strategies designed to respond to the climate-related risks and opportunities identified, including the approval of any emissions reduction targets, and ongoing risk management.
Nine are in the process of assessing the nature and extent 
of any climate-related targets relevant to the Group, with this assessment expected to be finalised in FY26. Should the Group set specific climate-related targets, the Group’s progress against these targets will be monitored by the Audit & Risk Management Committee on a quarterly basis. Remuneration
The People and Culture Committee is responsible  for overseeing executive remuneration arrangements, including annual reviews, and approval of short and long term incentive schemes for executives, to ensure they  are aligned with the Group's strategic objectives, ethical standards and regulatory requirements.
Nine is in the process of undertaking a review of our 
climate-related targets and broader sustainability strategies. Once this review is finalised and our future direction is determined, the People & Culture Committee will consider these outcomes in the context of setting appropriate executive remuneration arrangements, including whether to adopt Long Term Incentives for executive KMP to support the delivery of the ESG strategy and targets. Consistent with all executive remuneration arrangements, the People & Culture Committee will have oversight of any Long Term Incentives offered in future with performance criteria related to climate.
Risk Management process
Nine manages all risks, including climate-related risks, through its established risk management framework (detailed in the Reporting and Risk section of the annual report on Page 59). This framework focuses on ensuring appropriate governance and processes are in place to enable effective risk management. Nine’s risk management framework is embedded in decision-making, policies,  and procedures across the organisation, with ongoing Board oversight.
Climate-related risks are integrated with other material 
enterprise risks for a holistic approach to identification, assessment, and management. This process, led by the Group Risk Director and involving a cross-functional team, begins with each strategic planning cycle and includes annual reviews and reassessments after significant  events or changes to the Group.
Key climate-related risks and opportunities will be 
assessed as part of the annual enterprise risk assessment process and monitored by the ESG Working Group on  a bi-monthly basis. 
Our internal controls aim to ensure the accuracy, reliability, 
and integrity of financial and non-financial information,  as well as compliance with laws, regulations, and policies. Nine operates a control environment that is aimed at minimising control weaknesses, and identifying new risks promptly, supported by transparency and stakeholder engagement policies.Climate
We recognise the importance of sustainability and responsible operations across our value chain within  the media landscape. 
Our core business revolves around the creation and 
distribution of high-quality content across various platforms, engaging millions of Australians daily. Our key assets include broadcast infrastructure, production studios, digital platforms, and radio networks, primarily located within Australia.
Our operations are responsible for delivering some of 
Australia’s most-watched television programs, widely read news and lifestyle content, engaging digital experiences, and popular radio broadcasts. Nine prioritises the quality and reach of our content and the efficiency of our delivery, while also actively seeking to understand and minimise  our environmental footprint within our operational sphere.
The processes involved in creating, producing, and 
distributing our content vary based on the medium and its intended audience. These activities are typically performed using Nine’s equipment, studios, digital platforms, and transmission infrastructure, and are carried out by Nine employees and contracted partners. Distribution of our content to viewers, listeners, and readers typically involves broadcast networks, internet infrastructure, mobile networks, and digital platforms, some of which are owned and operated by Nine, while others are third-party services.
Our content and advertising solutions are offered through 
a variety of commercial arrangements, including long-term partnerships, advertising campaigns, and subscription models, depending on the platform and market conditions. Our audiences include individuals, households, and businesses across Australia. Demand for our content and advertising is typically based on audience preferences, economic conditions, and the effectiveness of our offerings.
Nine procures goods and services from local and 
international suppliers. Aside from property and employee costs, our main operational expenses relate to technology infrastructure, content production, transmission and distribution costs, and marketing and sales activities.
Nine is actively exploring and implementing more 
sustainable practices within our operations, particularly  in areas such as energy efficiency in our facilities and the environmental impact of our production processes.  We are also mindful of the sustainability practices  of our key suppliers
