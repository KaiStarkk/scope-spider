105 Iren Group | Annual Report 2024  
General basis for the preparation of the Consolidated 
Sustainability Statement  and disclosure s in relation to 
specific circumstances  
[BP-1_01, BP -1_02, BP -1_03, BP -1_04, BP -1_05, BP -1_06, BP -2_01, BP -2_03, BP -2_04, BP -2_05, BP -2_06, BP -2_07, BP -2_08, BP -2_09, BP -2_16, 
BP-2_17]  
Iren Group’s Consolidated Sustainability Statement  has been prepared on a consolidated basis in accordance with Legislative 
Decree no. 125/2024 implementing Directive 2022/2464/EU  (Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive  (CSRD), and in 
compliance with the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) for the period 1 January 2024  - 31 December 2024.  
This Statement  is the first to be prepared in accordance with ESRS standards, in place of the previous Consolidated Non -
Financial Disclosure prepared in accordance with GRI standards.  Therefore, in view of the possibility of making use of the 
phase -in measures provided for the first year of reporting, no comparative data have been presented.  
The scope  of the Consolidated Sustainability Statement  is the same as that for the Consolidated Financial Statements : all 
fully consolidated legal entities are included and are indicated in the List of Fully Consolidated Companies in the “Annexes to 
the Consolidated Financial Statements”.  It should be noted that no operational control was identified for any of the Group’s  
investees . 
This Consolidated Sustainability Statement  does not include any additional information from applicable legislation, with the 
exception of the information required by the European Taxonomy  (Art. 8 of Regulation (EU) no. 2020/852) ( see chapter  
European Taxonomy in section Green Transition ).  
Iren Group’s Consolidated Sustainability Statement  considers the entire value chain, thus including information on upstream 
and downstream segments when relevant. In particular, the upstream segment of the value chain includes first -tier suppliers 
and investees , assessing impacts, risks and opportunities related to the sustainable supply chain management approach 
adopted, while the downstream segment includes different types of customers and investees . The value chain information 
includes quantitative metrics on Scope 3 emissions for each significant categ ory (see paragraph “Scope 3 GHG emissions” 
in chapter Meeting the challenge of climate change ), qualitative information on relevant impacts, risks and opportunities (see 
paragraph “Double materiality assessment ” in chapter Strategy for sustainable development ) and related policies, actions 
and targets. For the reporting of Scope 3 GHG emissions related to the supply chain, methods aligned with the 
recommendations of the GHG Protocol were used: partly Scope 3 emissions were calculated through direct  access t o 
supplier emission data, partly they were calculated through a spend -based approach using sectoral emission factors. As part 
of its commitments to sustainable supply chain management, the Group aims to increase as much as possible the proportion 
of scope 3 emissions calculated using direct data, in order to carry out monitoring increasingly linked to the actual 
performance of suppliers, through the gradual extension of data collection directly from suppliers.  
Iren Group mainly uses quantitative data derived from its management systems and standardises the calculation of 
emissions through the use of emission factors derived from authoritative scientific and institutional sources.  In cases where 
the use of estima tes is necessary, these and the underlying assumptions are based on historical data, recognised regulatory 
or scientific methodologies, which are deemed to provide soundness and reliability. Detailed information on any estimates 
used can be found in the ch apters on each specific disclosure where the assumptions used and potential sources of 
uncertainty are also described.  
Iren Group did not omit any specific information on relevant issues relating to intellectual property, know -how, innovation, 
upcoming developments or matters under negotiation.  
In order to provide greater comprehensibility of its business model and strategy, the Group decided to supplement the 
reporting required by ESRS standards with entity -specific information, highlighted by the code “IREN_XXX” shown in grey.  
Indicators and data on future sustainability investments that are based on the assumptions underlying the 2030 Business 
Plan are included in the Statement . These include data on the green transition plan whose sources of uncertainty are related 
to regulatory and technological developments, changing market conditions also in relation to the geopolitical context, the 
development of climate policies and possib le updates in the measurement methodologies used. The main assumptions 
used in the forecasts concern p opulation development, municipal and special waste production, energy consumption trends, 
deployment of emission -capture technologies and low -carbon fuels, and cost estimates for implementing the actions of the 
ecological transition plan.  
The time horizons adopted by Iren Group in line with its strategy are: short -term (up to one year), medium -term (up to 5 years) 
and long -term ( more than 5 years).

119 Iren Group | Annual Report 2024  
The Iren Shareholders’ Meeting decides, upon appointment and for the entire term of office, the total annual remuneration of 
the members of the Board of Directors and the maximum total amount for the remuneration of the Directors holding specific 
office provided for in the Articles of Association (Chairperson, Deputy Chairperson and CE O).  
On the proposal of the Remuneration and Appointments Committee (RAC) and having consulted the Board of Statutory 
Auditors, the Board of Directors defines the structure and remuneration for Directors with specific duties (Chairperson, 
Deputy Chairperson and  CEO ), and the remuneration for Directors participating in Internal Board Committees. It also defines 
the Remuneration Policy for the Group’s Board of Directors and Senior Executives with Strategic Responsibilities subject to 
the RAC’s preliminary survey, carried out in conjunction with the CRSC, with regard to risk and sustainability profiles.  
Subject to the RAC’s preliminary survey , the Board of Directors defines the objectives to which the short - and long -term annual 
variable component of the remuneration of the Executive Chairperson, the Executive Deputy Chairperson and the Chief 
Executive Officer and General Manager  is correlated.  
The Deputy Chairperson determines the remuneration of Senior Executives with Strategic Responsibilities, taking into 
account the provisions of the Remuneration Policy, and defines the objectives to which their short - and long -term variable 
component is rel ated, after consulting the RAC, which may avail itself of external consultants specialising in remuneration 
policies.  
The remuneration of Non -Executive Directors is commensurate with the commitment required of each of them, also taking 
into account any participation in one or more Internal Board Committees.  
As regards the Directors with specific duties (Chairperson, Deputy Chairperson and CEO ), the gross annual remuneration for 
the positions held was established by the Board of Directors, after a survey carried out by the Remuneration and 
Appointments Committee, in compliance with the limits established by the Shareholders’ Meeting.  
For the Executive Chairperson, the Executive Deputy Chairperson, the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager and for 
Senior Executives with Strategic Responsibilities, the variable part of the remuneration is divided into two parts, the short -
term part  and the long -term part.  
Short -term variable remuneration  is paid upon achievement of all performance targets and is set, in the target amount, equal 
to: 30.3% of the gross annual salary for the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager ; 37.9% of the gross annual salary 
for the Executive Deputy Chairperson and Strategic Director of Human Resources, CSR and delegated areas; 30.8% of the 
gross annual salary for the Executive Chairperson and Strategic Director of Finance, Strategies and del egated areas; 37.6%, 
on average, of the gro ss annual salary of the other Senior Executives with Strategic Responsibilities in force at the end of the 
period of reference.  
The short -term variable remuneration is based on an MbO (Management by Objectives) system that takes into consideration 
the Group’s main objectives relating to economic and financial performance (weighting 40%), the main strategic projects 
(weighting 30%) and ESG factors (weighting 30%) through performance objectives linked to the priority areas of intervention 
defined in the Business Plan:  
• decarboni sation: reduction of the carbon intensity of energy production, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions, energy savings
in production processes, emissions avoided from the recovery of waste managed;
• circular economy: increase of sorted waste collection rates in the local areas served and of waste to material recovery
treated in Group plants, production of biomethane from biodegradable waste and reuse of purified water;
• water resources: increase of purification capacity in the local areas managed, reduction of water withdrawals from the
environment for distribution, reduction of leakages and division into districts of the aqueduct network;
• resilient cities: extension of district heating, increase of environmentally friendly vehicles in the corporate fleet, green
electricity sold to retail customers, energy savings from products/services offered by the Group;
• people: increase in recruitment, under 30 hires, training hours per employee, people evaluated on performance, quota of
female managers, accident incidence rate and coverage of employees with supplementary health care.
These objectives are also cascaded down to Company managers. 
The system provides a “gate” condition linked to the maintenance of the rating on investment grade by a leading rating 
agency. For 2024, in addition to the minimum threshold of the individual objective, equal to 60%, a minimum threshold of 
average overall achievement of the individual objectives greater than and/or equal to 70% has been established, as a further 
condition for access to the payment. In order to incentivise the Group’s value creation with respect to the planned targets, a 
correction factor fo r individual results with a priori defined weights and metrics was maintained in 2024 as well. The 
maximum amount attainable as short -term variable compensation can reach 120% of the target amount.  
The Plan for variable long -term remuneration  - L TI Plan 2022 -2024 (Long -Term Incentive), approved by the Board of Directors 
on 28 April 2022, provides for the accrual of a monetary bonus based on the 2022 -2024 three -year performance. The Plan 
has among its recipients: Executive Chairperson and Deput y Chairperson, Chief Executive Officer, Senior Executives with 
Strategic Responsibilities, and other Top Management resources capable of making a significant contribution to the 
achievement of the objectives of t he Business Plan.  
With reference to the executive Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson, the maximum monetary incentive was established by 
the Board of Directors, taking into account the indications of the Meeting, in an amount equal to 100% and 75%, respectively,  
of the total  gross annual variable compensation paid to the Chief Executive Officer and General Manager in office at the time 
of approval of the L TI Plan. For the other Senior Executives with strategic responsibilities, the maximum monetary incentive 
was set at 100% o f individual gross annual remuneration calculated as of 1 January 2022.  
The awarding of the prize is subject to the passing of a “gate” condition (recognition, at the end of 2024, of the Investment  
Grade rating by one of the major rating agencies) and the achievement of the following objectives, identified in accordance 
with t he provisions of the Business Plan: Cumulative EBITDA 2022 -2024 (weight: 35%); Cumulative Operating Cash Flow
