Sustainability Reporting Requirements
In preparation for the new Australian Sustainability Reporting 
Standards,  against which SKS Technologies will be required to 
report in FY27, the business has commenced an assessment of 
the necessary systems and processes required to capture, collate 
and analyse various aspects of environmental and other data.  
From 1 July 2026, the company will be required to understand and 
mitigate as much as possible the impact of the full spectrum of its 
operations on the environment.Fleet Emissions Reductions
To support the business’s environmental performance, a 
vehicle refresh program was undertaken during the year, which 
comprised the replacement of all vehicles older than four years.  
The new fleet is now more economical and will deliver a 224,760 
ton or 29.9% reduction in annual CO2 emissions from the FY24 
baseline of 750,900 tons.
As the new fleet was introduced progressively over the year, the 
reduction in CO2 emissions over the FY25 period was 159,780 
tons, representing a 21.3% decrease.
The new fleet vehicles are also equipped with the most advanced 
driving safety features to provide safe travel for all employees.  
The fleet now comprises 100 vehicles, including Hyundai Staria 
Vans and Mitsubishi Triton Utes.ENVIRONMENTAL COMMITMENT

aligned in practising and promoting company 
wide measures for efficiency in water and 
energy use, and a range of other measures to 
reduce the impact of the human footprint on 
the environment.
