We approach data privacy and cyber security as a 
Board-level risk, embedding legal compliance and 
employee capability-building to protect customer and 
business data. Our team undergoes mandatory privacy 
and cyber training on a regular basis, plus refresher 
training whenever our processes change. 
We prioritise transparent communication with our 
customers regarding how their data is collected, 
used and protected. Our technical safeguards include encryption protocols, 
multi-factor authentication and layered access controls 
for all customer-facing brands and internal systems. 
This approach, with team capability, robust technical 
controls and third-party assurance, aims to minimise  
risk and reinforce customer trust in our brands.
  For more information about our approach, see page 51Material topic:  Data privacy and security
Material topic:  Team health, safety and wellbeing
Material topic:  Energy and climate changeWe believe creating a positive and supportive work 
environment leads to improved employee satisfaction 
and long-term business success. This means the health, 
safety and wellbeing of our 30,000+ strong team is a 
core contributor to our business value. 
Everyone who works with our business is required 
to adhere to stringent health and safety protocols 
across our network of sites and has access to targeted 
wellbeing programs. We have a safety-first approach 
that requires regular risk assessments, incident 
reporting and mandatory work health and safety 
training, with Board-level oversight of trends and 
progress against targets. Our annual Voice of Team survey and regular listening 
sessions capture frontline feedback on overall 
engagement and retention, with results used to 
refine programs.
Through our wellbeing program, Endeavour Wellbeing 
and Support, we provide our team more holistic 
support across physical, mental and financial wellbeing. 
We also offer Mental Health First Aid training for leaders 
to build capability in supporting individuals who may 
be suffering a mental health crisis, until emergency or 
professional support is available.

Our management of energy and climate change 
combines long-term transition planning with near- and 
medium-term actions to help us to continue to reduce 
our environmental footprint.  
 
We recognise the importance of building an 
understanding of climate change impact on the 
business. Over the last few years, we have completed 
a climate risk assessment and a qualitative scenario 
analysis, and this year we have performed our first 
quantitative scenario analysis. We are still working 
through our findings and reviewing opportunities to 
integrate these risks into Endeavour’s enterprise risk 
management processes.
 This year, we have worked to strengthen the processes 
we use to capture, track and validate our scopes 1 and 2 
emissions, as well as building an inventory of our 
scope 3 emissions. We have also started to develop 
preliminary roadmaps to achieve our emissions 
reduction targets. 
Key initiatives are underway to address our material 
energy emissions, including continued roll-out of solar 
installations and transcritical refrigeration systems, as 
well as sourcing renewable energy for two of our winery 
and vineyard sites.

Building climate resilience 
Understanding our key risks and opportunities has helped us to prioritise areas of focus, identifying no-regret 
and low-regret actions to build climate resilience across our business. 
Five focus areas, determined across three key planning categories: transition, physical resilience and disclosure, 
have been considered under multiple scenarios. There are actions to address the climate-related impacts in these 
areas already underway, as well as actions which form part of our future business planning and decision-making.
Focus area Actions

Metrics and Targets
In our Sustainability Strategy, we committed 
to the following Planet targets:
• By 2030, sourcing 100% renewable electricity 
to power our business; and 
• By 2050, Endeavour Group will have net zero 
emissions (Scope 1 and 2 only). 
As our operations and supply chains are complex and 
geographically diverse, the collection and validation 
of our emissions data has proven challenging to date. 
This, in turn, has impacted our ability to accurately 
track and report progress against targets. 
In F25, we prioritised two major streams of work:
1. Governance uplift : working to improve the 
completeness and accuracy of our emissions data, 
as well as improving the governance, controls 
and process of data collection in order to meet 
and assure against the incoming Australian 
Sustainability Reporting Standards. In F25, our 
total energy consumed was 1,992,026 GJ,and our 
total Scope 1 and 2 emissions contributed 356,599 
tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO₂e). For 
more information and context, see Appendix page 
65, and page 29 of the 2025 Endeavour Group 
Annual Report. 
2. Development of preliminary roadmaps : 
timelines and targets to reduce Scope 1 and 2 
emissions to net zero. 
We have also continued to implement a range of 
initiatives to reduce emissions and drive efficiencies, 
as outlined below. 
Solar installations
277 sites have solar installations, with 58 additional 
sites added in F25. Since the introduction of our solar 
program, we’ve developed a better understanding 
of the systems, components and brands we 
need to guarantee quality, durability and visibility 
on performance. Solar installations generated 
22,371 MWh of power in F25, with additional 
installations planned in F26.Sourcing renewable energy
Our Cape Mentelle (Margaret River region, WA) and 
Isabel Estate 1 (Marlborough region, NZ) sites sourced 
100% renewable electricity for power usage. 
Smart control systems
175 of our retail sites feature smart control systems, 
which allow our teams to centrally manage light and air 
conditioning settings and automate soft fridge covers.
Refrigeration
As refrigeration remains a large component of our 
energy usage, we review new technologies to reduce 
impact wherever possible. In new sites, we are installing 
energy efficient transcritical refrigeration systems, 
which use CO2 instead of synthetic refrigeration gases 
and are considered lower-emissions options. In F25, we 
installed seven new transcritical systems in retail sites, 
including Bacchus Marsh, Heathcote and Middle Park.
Electronic Shelf Labelling
Electronic Shelf Labelling (ESL) has replaced paper 
ticketing in all 282 Dan Murphy’s stores nationally, saving 
an estimated eight million sheets annually. Powered 
by energy efficient, long lasting battery systems, ESLs 
provide a better customer experience with improved 
pricing accuracy. LED ‘light up’ functionality supports 
locating products using the ‘Ask Uncle Dan’ app.

Scope 3 emissions
Quantifying indirect (Scope 3) emissions across our value chain remains a complex task, given the number of 
contributing sources and the variability of available data. Scope 3 emissions include all indirect greenhouse gas 
emissions that occur across Endeavour’s value chain, excluding those from owned or directly controlled sources. 
Since F23 we have progressively continued to develop an indicative inventory of Scope 3 emissions using the 
GHG Protocol in preparation for future reporting requirements. 
By analysing available data and assessing our ability to influence outcomes in each area, we identified six material 
categories for calculation and future disclosure. In F26, we plan to disclose our baseline Scope 3 inventory and 
targets based off F25 data.

In F25, we completed installation of our 
Electronic Vehicle (EV) charging station at 
Gepps Cross Hotel in Adelaide. This site 
takes the number of EV charging stations 
across our network to eleven, delivering a 
reliable and fast charging experience for our 
customers while they dine or shop with us. 
Two further installations are planned for 
F26 as we continue to trial initiatives to 
help reduce our Scope 3 emissions.
