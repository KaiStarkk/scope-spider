Environmental, Social and Governance
At Regis, we are committed to integrating sustainable and ethical 
practices throughout our operations and business value chain. 
We recognise that robust environmental, social and governance 
(ESG) practices are essential to our residents, clients, employees, 
shareholders and the communities we serve. Our ESG initiatives 
are designed to enhance compliance, reduce operational costs, 
minimise our environmental impact, collectively improve our 
performance, while building a climate resilient future for all. 
ESG governance at Regis is overseen by the Board and Executive 
Leadership Team, with responsibilities distributed across key 
committees. The Sustainability Working Group provides strategic 
guidance, while the Sustainability Manager leads implementation, 
stakeholder engagement and data collection. ESG performance is 
supported by structured reporting and both internal and external 
audits, ensuring transparency and continuous improvement. This 
governance structure enables alignment between sustainability 
priorities and broader business objectives, while also supporting 
regulatory compliance and stakeholder expectations. 
Climate Resilience at Regis
As an industry leader, Regis recognises the importance of 
adapting to both the evolving needs of the ageing population 
and the environmental challenges that affect us all. Regis is 
dedicated to leading the transformation in how our residents 
live and how we operate as a business to be more sustainable. 
By taking proactive steps to reduce our environmental impact, 
we aim to not only enhance the operational efficiency of our 
Homes but also improve the health and wellbeing of our 
residents. Climate change poses significant challenges, from 
severe weather events to disruptions in supply chains and rising 
energy costs. By managing and mitigating these risks, we can 
reduce our environmental impact and improve operational 
efficiency. At Regis, building a climate-resilient future is essential 
to safeguarding business continuity, maintaining seamless 
operations and supply chains and creating climate-resilient 
environments for our employees and residents.
Climate Disclosures
In response to the increasing visibility and awareness of climate 
change impacts, the Australian Government introduced 
Mandatory climate-related disclosures through the Australian 
Accounting Standards Board (AASB), under the Australian 
Sustainability Reporting Standards (ASRS). As a Group 1 entity, 
Regis will begin reporting in line with these requirements in FY26, 
as its first reporting year. Regis is actively preparing to meet 
mandatory climate disclosure requirements. 
A new emissions Baseline 
Regis has designated the 2023 financial year (FY23) as its 
new base year for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reporting,  
in alignment with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol: Corporate 
Accounting and Reporting Standard. This decision reflects 
a commitment to transparency, accuracy and continuous 
improvement in our environmental performance. The  
re-establishment of FY23 as the base year was informed  
by the following considerations:
• Organisational Changes: Significant structural changes, 
including the acquisition of new sites and operations, 
have altered the organisational boundaries, necessitating  
a revised baseline.• Data Integrity: FY23 represents the first year in which a 
complete and verifiable dataset was available, including 
emissions from refrigerant use, enabling a more accurate 
representation of scope 1 and scope 2 emissions.
• Methodology improvements: FY23 Emissions calculation,  
data collection and verification followed a robust approach  
with higher accuracy and completeness. 
• Post-Pandemic Stability: FY23 reflects a return to typical 
operational conditions following the disruptions caused by  
the COVID-19 pandemic.
Emissions for FY23 and FY24 have been recalculated in 
accordance with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Analysis  
identified scope 2 electricity emissions as the primary emissions 
hotspot, followed by scope 1 emissions from stationary fuel.

Scope 2 31,756.18 27,488.35 26,712.49
Total Scope 1 & 2 37,343.42 34,824.97 34,136.53
* Tons of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions
Notes:  
•  Scope 1 emission sources include Natural gas, LPG, Stationary Diesel fuel,  
Transport fuel and Refrigerants.
• Scope 2 emissions include emissions from purchased grid electricity.
• Emissions reported in the above table are unaudited.
FY25 witnessed a 24% decrease in Scope 1 emissions, while 
Scope 2 electricity emissions increased by 16%, reflecting a shift  
in Regis’ energy reliance strategy from gas to electricity. Overall 
emissions increased by 7% in FY25, mainly driven by business 
growth and acquisitions.

Scope 2 192.87 160.21 153.22
Total Scope 1 & 2 280.65 284.22 277.03
* Tera Joules of energy 
Scope 1 energy consumption decreased by 29%, while Scope 2 
energy consumption increased by 20%, reflecting a shift in Regis’ 
energy reliance strategy from gas to electricity. 
Overall, combined Scope 1 and 2 energy consumption decreased 
by 1% in FY25.
Emissions and energy per Site 
In FY25, Regis concluded a review of its previously stated energy 
reduction target, which aimed at a 10% combined reduction  
by FY24 using an FY19 baseline. This target, while appropriate  
at the time of its establishment, no longer reflects the scale and 
nature of Regis’ current operations. The business has undergone 
significant growth and transformation since FY19, including 
acquisitions and expanded service delivery, which have materially 
impacted energy consumption patterns. OUR STRATEGY

Building for Climate Resilience
Regis has developed Environmentally Sustainable 
Design (ESD) Guidelines to support the integration of 
climate-responsive principles across new developments, 
refurbishments, fit-outs and operational upgrades. These 
guidelines are designed to ensure that Regis facilities are 
built and maintained with long-term sustainability and 
resilience in mind. The ESD framework focuses on:
• Energy and water efficiency to reduce environmental 
impact and operational costs
• Material reuse and responsible sourcing  to support 
circular economy outcomes
• Climate-adaptive design features  that enhance resilience 
to extreme weather and future climate conditions
By embedding these principles into the design and 
construction process, Regis is creating safer, more  
efficient and environmentally responsible spaces for 
residents and staff. This initiative reflects our commitment 
to future-proofing our infrastructure and delivering lasting 
value to the communities we serve.Key ESG ProgramKey ESG Program
Energy Resilience: Building a Future-Ready Regis
Regis is committed to building a future-ready organisation 
that can withstand and adapt to the challenges posed by 
climate change. Our Energy Resilience Strategy is designed 
to ensure the safety, security and continuity of care for 
residents and staff — 24/7 and in any climate scenario.
As of FY25, 58% of our homes are equipped with solar 
panels, marking a significant step toward decentralised 
and renewable energy generation. This foundation 
supports our broader goal of creating climate-resilient 
homes, businesses and supply chains .
The strategy embraces a hybrid energy model , combining:
• Grid electricity  for reliability and scale
•  On-site solar generation  for sustainability and  
cost efficiency
• Flexible energy systems  capable of operating  
across multiple energy sources to ensure continuity 
during disruption. This integrated approach will enable Regis to reduce 
emissions and energy cost, enhance operational resilience 
during climate-related events, support long-term 
sustainability goals and strengthen energy independence 
across our portfolio.
In FY25, Regis Dandenong North was a recent addition to 
our solar portfolio, with 99kW rooftop solar power. This 
solar installation is expected to generate approximately 
138,671kWh of electricity annually, contributing to a 
reduction in grid energy use. The expansion of renewable 
energy infrastructure will support operational resilience, 
manage exposure to rising energy costs and lower 
emissions associated with energy consumption.
The Energy Resilience Strategy is a cornerstone of Regis’ 
climate adaptation planning and reflects our commitment 
to safeguarding the wellbeing of our communities while 
contributing to a low-carbon future.
