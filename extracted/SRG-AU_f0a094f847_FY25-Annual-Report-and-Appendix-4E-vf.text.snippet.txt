Community Engagement Leadership
SRG Global’s approach to delivering essential 
infrastructure is underpinned by strong, respectful 
relationships with the communities we serve. 
Working within collaborative delivery models, 
we embed engagement from the earliest stages, 
ensuring local voices, priorities, and opportunities 
shape outcomes.
Our in-house Community and Stakeholder 
Engagement team plays a pivotal role during the 
Early Contractor Involvement phase, leveraging 
digital technology and creative engagement 
methods to deliver positive, inclusive experiences 
for clients and communities alike. Initiatives such 
as community information days, partnerships with 
First Nations peoples, education pathways through 
TAFE, and QR-enabled project signage promote 
transparency, accessibility, and social acceptance.
By integrating these practices across our projects, 
we not only achieve our clients’ delivery objectives 
but also create enduring social value—leaving 
a meaningful legacy and advancing our shared 
commitment to community-focused, sustainable 
infrastructure delivery.CASE STUDYASSET INTEGRITY INSPECTION, WESTERN AUSTRALIA
Sustainability at SRG Global is about creating real impact 
through outcomes that leave a lasting legacy of tangible 
outcomes. Our commitment is underpinned by a clear 
framework built around three core principles that drive our 
strategic decisions, empower our people, and shape our 
partnerships and innovation. The ESG Framework guides 
our efforts to deliver long-term, sustainable outcomes, 
laying the groundwork for more climate-resilient practices 
across all areas of our business. Ultimately, it is our people 
who enable us to drive substantive change and build a 
more sustainable future. By investing in partnerships that 
support diversity, sustainable operations, and community 
outcomes, we are accelerating positive change whilst 
delivering real and lasting impact.
ZERO HARM
As always, SRG Global’s journey towards Zero Harm 
continues, and our commitment remains steadfast; as I 
always say it is the glass ball we cannot afford to drop. 
Our established Zero Harm committees, which operate at 
all levels of the business, including the Board, continue to 
set clear goals, provide necessary training, and encourage 
active participation in our safety journey. However, it is our 
people, regardless of role or location, that truly brings Zero 
Harm to life. Zero Harm is not something that happens; it is 
something we each protect and improve on every day.
Our safety-conscious culture, driven by visible leadership, 
individual accountability, and positive engagement, has 
yielded strong performance. Every person at SRG Global 
is empowered, and expected, to take ownership of safety. 
Together, we actively manage our identified critical risks 
and support one another to prevent harm. Beyond physical 
safety, our Zero Harm philosophy extends to psychological 
well-being and aims to ensure a supportive environment in 
which employees not only feel safe but also thrive.
While our efforts have led to positive outcomes, we 
recognise that the journey towards Zero Harm is 
ongoing. To this end, safety remains front-of-mind across 
all operations, and it is our collective and individual 
commitment that will ensure we continue to protect what 
matters most, each other.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED 30 JUNE 202527
SRG GLOBAL 2025 ANNUAL REPORTRISK MANAGEMENT
To ensure SRG Global continues to deliver value to its internal and external stakeholders the Company understands the need to 
manage its exposure to events that may impact its ability to achieve its strategic objectives. The impact of these events range 
in severity and are managed both at an operational and corporate level. In its assessment of severity, the Company recognises 
the significant material risk events (MRE) it is exposed to are: 
• Changes in regulation and regulators. 
• Safety and harm to employees.
• Global and domestic financial market conditions.
• Climate conditions, predominantly in regional and remote locations.
• Disruption to Information Technology systems and Cyber Security events.
• Client appetites to contract risk transfer.
The Company’s exposure and response to each MRE are summarised in the table below: 
MRE Impact Assessment
Changes in regulation 
and regulatorsThe Company operates across a number of domestic (Australian) states and territories, with 
permanent operations in New Zealand and intermittent project works in multinational jurisdictions. 
In addition to operations, the Company is an importer of goods from certain international markets 
including China.
Amendments to regulations, regulators or geopolitical instability can impact the operations of the 
Company by:
• Requiring it to carry more liquidity.
• Increasing employment of locals or nationals.
• Altering the structure of its operations including the diversification of existing markets and 
industry segments.
• Investment in new technologies or equipment (including low or reduced emissions products).
• Disrupting its supply chain.
To manage its exposure to this MRE the Company constantly monitors changes in the domestic and 
international regulatory environments in which it operates and its reliance on certain markets for 
its supply chain operations. The results of such monitoring activities include alterations to business 
continuity planning, sourcing of alternative suppliers, resourcing requirements and entry into new and 
emerging markets, or divesture from existing markets. 
Safety and harm  
to employeesEmployees of the Company operate in industries which can carry inherent risk of injury and harm to 
themselves and members of the community. Management of the exposure to injury and harm remains 
a key priority for the Board, the Executive Leadership Team (ELT) and is embedded in the core values 
of SRG Global. 
The Company maintains a strong focus on safety with a health and safety framework certified to 
ISO45001 for occupational health and safety management. Supplementing this certification is a 
stringent review process of safety and safety incidents across the Company’s operations led by the 
Zero Harm Leadership Team, filtered down to site operations and a strong culture of ‘Have Each 
Others Backs’.Directors’ Report (CONTINUED)
