PRL Group’s Roadmap for the 2026 financial year will keep us on our core path to deliver the critical ESG programs we have 
established, while also putting significant emphasis on preparing for the roll-in to the new S2 sustainability standards.
In respect of S2 Compliance, the key focus this coming year will be conducting a pre-audit readiness assessment and reviewing 
the recommendations. The intent will be to put focus on any gap areas to ensure full compliance by the time the Company is 
required to comply with the new standard in 2027 financial year.ESG Roadmap
