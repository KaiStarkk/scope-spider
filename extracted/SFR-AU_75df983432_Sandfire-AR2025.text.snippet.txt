Our sustainability reporting
Our sustainability reporting aims to describe our performance in relation to the material issues that affect our stakeholders. 
Our reporting boundary  
All content and data provided refers to 
our fiscal year ended 30 June 2025, and 
includes Assets and exploration projects 
where we have 100% ownership2. Assets 
where we have 100% ownership include 
DeGrussa, MATSA and Motheo. In addition 
to these Assets, Sandfire also has 100% 
ownership of our exploration activities in 
Spain, Botswana and Portugal. The FY25 
Sustainability Databook includes additional 
details on our reporting boundary.
Disclosure standards 
Content is informed by voluntary global 
sustainability frameworks, standards, 
benchmarks and initiatives including but 
not limited to:
• Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 
Standards: for more information, refer 
to our FY25 Sustainability Databook.• Taskforce on Nature-related Financial 
Disclosures (TNFD): for more 
information, refer to the Biodiversity 
section of this report.
• International Council on Mining and 
Metals.
Reporting is also guided by the United 
Nations Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs) and the United Nations Global 
Compact (UNGC). As a signatory to the 
UNGC, this report supports our UNGC 
Communication on Progress (COP). 
We acknowledge the pace at which 
global sustainability disclosure standards 
are evolving and will continue to monitor 
developments including additions to 
the Australian Sustainability Reporting 
Standards (ASRS), advancements in the 
United Kingdom Sustainability Reporting 
Standards and changes to the EU 
Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence 
Directive (CSDDD). We have produced a separate FY25 
Modern Slavery Statement that complies 
with the Australian Modern Slavery Act 
2018  and UK Modern Slavery Act 2015 . For 
more information, see our Modern Slavery 
Statement.  
Assurance
Deloitte has provided independent limited 
assurance on our Scope 1 and 2 GHG 
emissions and health and safety metrics. 
Other FY25 data including that contained in 
the accompanying Sustainability Databook 
has been verified through internal 
processes.In developing our sustainability 
goals, we considered the SDG’s, 
how they apply to the communities 
in which we operate and identified 
where we believe we can have 
the greatest impact. We have 
prioritised 10 SDGs. This report 
includes information on how we have 
contributed to the SDGs in FY25.  Ten SDGs where Sandfire can have the greatest impact:Supporting the UN Sustainable Development Goals
2 For climate related data, the reporting boundary for the ‘Sandfire Group’ is defined by ‘operational control’ as recommended within The Greenhouse Gas Protocol.Engaging with our stakeholders 
Sandfire is committed to open and transparent engagement with our stakeholders. 
Our stakeholders include individuals and groups of people who have the potential to interact with, influence or be impacted by our business. 
We tailor our engagement approach to stakeholder needs, interests and preferred methods of engagement.

Looking forward, there is a projected medium-term supply deficit in mined copper under a base case scenario (with an even larger supply 
deficit under a low carbon transition scenario). This supply deficit, combined with increasing demand, is likely to support a favourable pricing 
environment for copper miners in the near-term.

We have a unique opportunity to build climate resilience as we decarbonise our operations:
• Physical Climate Resilience: We can improve our resilience to the physical impacts of climate change by undertaking adaptation studies 
and implementing additional initiatives where required.
• Decarbonisation and Energy Supply:  Energy efficiency and behind-the-meter electricity generation is becoming more financially viable 
due to technology learning rates (making the technology cheaper per kWh) and higher energy prices (across both electricity and 
diesel). Behind-the-meter generation paired with energy storage may also increase energy security at our Assets.
Additional opportunities identified include: 
• Ability to access a growing pool of finance as institutions look to invest in ‘greener’ metals and take a position in lower carbon energy 
markets. The flow of capital into lower carbon technologies presents an opportunity for our business to access these funds to increase 
our resilience. 
• Potential streamlining of regulatory approvals or increased government support or subsidies for significant metals like copper, or 
renewable energy projects.
• Improved reputation, brand value and social licence to operate.
• Ability to develop lower carbon products as the market develops and obtain premiums. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Decarbonisation
Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions
In FY25, our total5 Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions were 252,582 tCO2e, representing an increase of 21% compared to FY246. Table 5 
provides details on our GHG emissions across our operating Assets and Group7. Further information can be found in the FY25 Sustainability 
Data Book. In FY25, our gross GHG emissions increased relative to FY24. This was projected in our analysis from FY24 as a results of the 
ramp up in production at Motheo.

6 After restatements due to application of changed GHG emissions factors.
7 Our FY25 GHG emissions disclosure excludes GHG emissions related to land disturbance. In FY26, we will further develop our understanding of the GHG emissions related to land 
disturbance, particularly around the key drivers at each Asset.
8 Scope 2 market-based GHG emissions are equal to scope 2 location-based GHG emissions due to the absence of market mechanisms.FY25 GHG Restatements
As part of the AASB S2 gap analysis, we reviewed our GHG emissions calculations including our operational boundaries and applied 
emissions factors used in FY24. This analysis identified the following four areas to improve accuracy for FY25 reporting and subsequent 
compliance in FY26:
1. Scope 2 location-based GHG 
emissions factor for Botswana:  As a 
proxy for the grid emissions factor in 
FY24 we used the Operating Margin 
Grid Emissions Factor for Botswana 
from the IFI Dataset of Default Grid 
Factors v3.2 (1.49 kgCO2e / kWh), 
however since December 2024 we 
applied the Combined Margin Grid 
Emissions Factor for Botswana from 
the IFI Dataset of Default Grid Factors 
v3.2 (1.07 kgCO2e / kWh).
2. Scope 1 diesel GHG emissions 
factor for Spain: In FY24, all of 
MATSA’s GHG emissions related to 
diesel consumption were calculated 
using MITECO’s “B7 - Comercial, 
institucional e industrial” emissions 
factor.  In recognition of the different types of 
diesel consumed, diesel consumption 
is now apportioned using the “B7 - 
Comercial, institucional e industrial” 
(2.501 kgCO2e / litre) and “Gasóleo 
B - Comercial, institucional e industrial” 
(2.703 kgCO2e / litre) factors.
3. Black Butte Copper Project: The 
Black Butte Copper Project has 
been excluded from our FY25 GHG 
emissions reporting and climate-
related targets because we do not 
currently have operational control.4. Logistics between our Sotiel Mine and 
MATSA’s processing hub:  Transport 
of the ore extracted from Sotiel to 
MATSA’s processing hub is contracted 
to a third-party. This was previously 
reported as Scope 1 GHG emissions. 
It is now being treated as Scope 3 
Category 4 - Upstream Transportation 
and Distribution GHG emissions.
5. Scope 1 Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change (IPCC) mobile 
combustion diesel GHG emissions 
factor: Where local GHG emissions 
factors aren’t available, IPCC factors 
are used.
