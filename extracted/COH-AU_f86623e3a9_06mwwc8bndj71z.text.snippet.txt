Commitment to investment in R&D
Our market-leading technology underpins our global market 
share of over 60%3. In FY25, we continued to lift our investment 
in R&D, investing a record $292 million, or 12% of sales revenue. 
We launched new products, made great advancements in our 
product and services pipeline and commenced our drug eluting 
electrode pivotal studies.  
By delivering our latest sound processor upgrade technology 
to our recipient base, we helped over 46,000 of our prior 
generation cochlear implant recipients to hear better, improving 
their hearing and quality of life.
Empowering growth through culture and 
sustainability 
Our people are at the heart of everything we do—their skills, 
passion, and commitment are essential to driving innovation, 
delivering exceptional outcomes for our customers, and building 
a resilient, future-ready organisation. 
To support our business growth, we have actively strengthened 
our organisational culture by investing in targeted training, 
leadership development, and employee empowerment 
initiatives. These efforts have resulted in sustained employee 
engagement at 80%, reflecting a workforce that is motivated, 
aligned with our purpose, and equipped to contribute 
meaningfully to our success. 
This year we also achieved significant milestones towards 
our net-zero emissions objectives. We completed our Scope 
3 emissions inventory, disclosing the outcomes for the first 
time. We are now better able to understand the key sources of 
emissions so that we can focus our reduction initiatives.Strengthening governance through Board 
renewal
We have continued to refresh our Board, welcoming new 
directors who bring diverse perspectives and relevant expertise, 
while preserving continuity and corporate knowledge. As 
part of this renewal, long-serving director Glen Boreham AM 
will retire from the Board in October, following a decade of 
dedicated service. 
We are pleased to announce that Richard Freudenstein will 
join the Board on 25 August 2025. Richard brings extensive 
experience in leading complex, regulated businesses and 
driving transformation across both emerging and established 
enterprises.
Delivering shareholder value
In FY25, sales revenue increased by 4% to $2,356 million, driven 
by strong growth in Cochlear and Acoustic implants. This 
growth was moderated by a decline in Services revenue.
Underlying net profit rose by 1% to $392 million, landing within 
the revised guidance range announced in June. Despite a 
more challenging year in our Services business, this result 
demonstrates the resilience of our core business and disciplined 
financial management.
Our balance sheet remains robust, with net cash of $276 million, 
providing the flexibility to fund strategic investments, support 
innovation, and deliver returns to shareholders.
Reflecting our confidence in the business and commitment to 
shareholder value, full-year dividends increased by 5% to $4.30 
per share, representing a 72% payout of underlying net profit.

Environmental responsibility 
We are advancing our net-zero strategy, enhancing emissions transparency, and embedding sustainability more broadly 
across our operations and product development.
Pathway to net-zero carbon emissions
We continue to make good progress towards our net-zero targets. We have reduced Scope 
1 and 2 emissions by 71% from our FY19 baseline by increasing renewable energy use at our 
manufacturing sites. We reached 99% renewable energy at our manufacturing facilities, using 
100% renewable energy in five of our six facilities. And we reduced the number of flights taken 
per full time employee by 40% from our FY19 baseline.
We disclosed our Scope 3 emissions inventory for the first time, enabling us to better 
understand the key sources of emissions so that we can focus our reduction initiatives. The 
distribution of products to customers and business travel contributes the vast majority of 
emissions, representing around 70% of all emissions.
We are strengthening our collaboration with freight partners to advance low-carbon logistics 
and improve coordination of freight movements. We are also optimising shipping routes and 
streamlining the direct sourcing of key components, significantly reducing travel distances and 
eliminating intermediate transit steps for certain products.
Sustainable packaging
The Nucleus Nexa System packaging features a sustainable paper-based design that reflects 
our commitment to reducing environmental impact. Recyclable and designed to minimise 
plastic use and waste, the new packaging delivers the high level of product protection required 
to safely and securely deliver our sound processor activation kits, while aligning with our 
broader sustainability goals.Scope 3 assured
