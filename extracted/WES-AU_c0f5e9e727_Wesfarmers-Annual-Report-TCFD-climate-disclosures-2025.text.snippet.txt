Climate-related disclosures
Our approach
Our response to climate change and the 
transition to a low-emissions economy 
aligns with our corporate objective and 
focus on sustainable, long-term value 
creation. Our divisions work in a 
disciplined way to decarbonise their 
operations, manage climate-related risks, 
develop climate-related partnerships and, 
where appropriate invest in climate-
related growth opportunities. 
Our divisions are managed with climate 
and carbon awareness, with continued 
focus on reducing operational Scope 1 
and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions 
(operational emissions). All divisions have 
set interim and net zero operational 
emissions targets that reflect their unique 
business attributes and operational 
emissions profiles. We regularly monitor 
and report our performance and progress 
towards interim and net zero operational 
emissions targets and divisions report 
on relevant categories of Scope 3 
emissions. This year, the divisions 
continued to mature their analysis of their 
Scope 3 value-chain emissions to better 
understand reduction opportunities and 
areas of influence.As a large, diversified Group, 
decarbonisation of some industrial 
processes in our operations and value 
chain depends on a range of solutions 
and technologies becoming commercially 
viable and operating at scale. Across our 
value chain, where the Group’s influence 
varies, partnerships and engagement are 
essential to support suppliers and 
customers in transitioning to a low-
emissions economy, recognising there 
are differences between our divisions 
and others in the sectors in which 
they operate. 
This year, we established cross-functional 
and divisional workstreams to prepare 
for the implementation of the Australian 
Accounting Standards Board’s (AASB) 
ASRS S2. Building on previous years' 
work, we enhanced the management 
and monitoring of climate-related risks 
and opportunities to support greater 
alignment with the Group’s enterprise 
risk management and corporate 
planning processes.We are developing a Group climate-
related financial reporting framework 
to establish a consistent approach 
among our businesses to assess the 
financial impacts of climate-related 
risks and opportunities. This year, 
we commissioned an externally-led, 
independent review of Group climate-
related governance processes which 
are central to the Group’s approach 
to responding to climate change.
Australia’s mandatory climate-related 
financial disclosure requirements apply 
to the Group from 1 July 2025 for financial 
year 2026 reporting. As the ASRS S2 
expands on the recommendations of the 
Task Force on Climate-related Financial 
Disclosures (TCFD), Wesfarmers 
continues to report climate-related 
disclosures using the TCFD framework 
during this last transition year.Wesfarmers supports the transition to a low-emissions economy.

Governance
Effective governance is central to the Group’s approach to responding to climate 
change. The Wesfarmers Board has ultimate responsibility for overseeing the Group’s 
approach to identifying, managing, monitoring and reporting of climate-related 
risks and opportunities. CONSIDERS AND ENDORSESWesfarmers Board
BOARD COMMITTEES
Audit and Risk Committee
The Audit and Risk Committee is responsible for assisting and 
updating the Board on climate-related risks, opportunities, reporting 
and other matters. The Audit and Risk Committee received climate 
updates from management in the 2025 calendar year and, during 
the 2025 financial year, has reviewed the Climate Policy, internal 
carbon price, strategic initiatives, performance against divisional 
targets, risk appetite and other climate-related matters. Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee takes account of various 
sustainability considerations (including climate) when determining 
the remuneration of key management personnel and makes 
recommendations to the Board regarding executive remuneration 
in respect of performance against climate and emissions 
reduction targets.LEADSWesfarmers Leadership Team
DIVISIONAL BOARDS 
Divisional audit, risk and compliance committees
The Wesfarmers Leadership Team, including divisional managing directors, provides leadership to support a culture of climate awareness. 
Divisional managing directors provide oversight on the development and implementation of divisional climate-related strategies, targets, 
monitoring of progress and stakeholder engagement.
Matters relevant to climate change risks are reported periodically to divisional audit, risk and compliance committees and boards. 
Each divisional board (through its audit, risk and compliance committee) and its divisional leadership team is responsible for identifying 
and managing material climate-related risks and opportunities relevant to the division, in accordance with the Group’s Risk Management 
Framework and Risk Appetite Statement and as part of the annual corporate planning and budget processes.
Through the annual corporate planning process, each division forecasts emissions and details decarbonisation strategies in its corporate 
plan for consideration and approval by the Wesfarmers Board.
CORPORATE OFFICEDELIVERSDivisional leadership teams
SUSTAINABILITY AND CARBON AND ENERGY TEAMS
Regular cross-functional engagement between operations, asset management, maintenance, merchandising, 
risk, property, supply chain, finance and corporate affairs teams
Divisional leadership teams are responsible for integrating climate-related risks, opportunities and other considerations into their corporate 
plans and operations.
Sustainability and carbon and energy teams, with support from other business functions and teams, coordinate and implement Wesfarmers’ 
Climate Policy, strategies and actions, and maintain systems for monitoring and reporting divisional performance. The cross-functional 
engagement also helps align risk management with strategic planning, emissions reduction initiatives and compliance reporting to enable 
coordinated decision-making across the divisions and Group.
Wesfarmers has an internal audit program that reviews operations 
on an ongoing basis. Findings from these audits are reported to 
divisional audit, risk and compliance committees as well as the 
Wesfarmers Audit and Risk Committee. Internal audit

Corporate Office
The Wesfarmers Corporate Office 
supports the Group by setting the Climate 
Policy, determining the internal carbon 
price and supporting the development 
of climate-related aspects of corporate 
plans. It also facilitates cross-divisional 
collaboration through a quarterly Carbon 
and Energy Forum, which brings together 
subject matter experts from across the 
Group with day-to-day responsibility 
for coordinating and managing climate-
related programs. The Carbon and 
Energy Forum facilitates knowledge-
sharing across our divisions, which span 
diverse sectors and emissions profiles.
Climate Policy
The Climate Policy is considered and 
endorsed by the Wesfarmers Board and 
is reviewed annually for relevance and 
alignment of community expectations. 
The Climate Policy establishes minimum 
internal requirements for managing 
climate-related risks and opportunities 
across the Group and aligns divisional 
strategies with the Group’s approach.  
The Climate Policy is available at  
wesfarmers.com.au/cg
Skills and training
Topic-specific training and briefings 
by internal and external specialists 
for directors, management and team 
members develops and maintains 
skills and competencies on climate-
related matters.
During the year, the Board received 
briefings on its obligations under the 
mandatory climate-related financial 
reporting legislation and other climate-
related matters. For team members, external specialists delivered 
refresher training on technical energy 
and emissions reporting and briefings 
that focused on greenwashing risk, 
as well as Wesfarmers-specific training 
on the broader requirements associated 
with sustainability disclosures following 
the publishing of guidance by the 
Australian Competition & Consumer 
Commission and Australian Securities 
and Investments Commission. 
Across the Group, team members 
engage with diverse businesses and 
industries and are also members of 
external sustainability and climate-related 
committees and forums. Participation 
in these committees and forums allows 
Wesfarmers to contribute and benefit 
from cross-industry and organisational 
expertise and the skills of external 
organisations.
Capital allocation and funding 
Wesfarmers’ approach to resource 
allocation, including capital allocation 
and funding, is based on the Group’s 
objective and focus on long-term value 
creation. Both internal mechanisms and 
market-based incentives are used to 
support decarbonisation and coordinate 
decision-making for capital allocation. 
Since 2014, Wesfarmers has applied 
an internal carbon price which acts as a 
commercial incentive for our businesses 
to strategically plan emissions reductions 
and anticipate future costs, by attaching 
a price to emissions associated with an 
investment or operation. Across the 
Group an internal carbon price (with 
a range of $41 to $145 over the period 
to 2050) is currently applied to: –Capital expenditure: through the 
Group Capital Expenditures and 
Disposal Policy, divisions are required 
to apply the Wesfarmers internal 
carbon price as a cost to emissions 
arising from capital projects or to 
quantify the benefit associated with 
emissions reductions arising from 
abatement projects and the disposal 
of businesses and assets
 –Mergers and acquisitions (M&A): 
where a cost is assigned to projected 
future operational emissions associated 
with potential acquisitions, for use in 
valuations and
 –Corporate planning: to reflect the 
impact of potential future emissions 
and carbon costs on earnings and 
cash flows, where not otherwise 
applied through a regulatory or 
compliance regime.
This year, the Group secured a 
$100 million financing package from 
the Clean Energy Finance Corporation 
to support investment in decarbonisation 
projects at Bunnings, Officeworks 
and WesCEF. 
Since 2020, Wesfarmers has utilised 
sustainable finance markets with funding 
linked to decarbonisation targets in 
WesCEF, Bunnings Group, Kmart Group 
and Officeworks. In total, the Group has 
issued approximately $2 billion in 
sustainability-linked bonds (SLBs), with 
the issuances linking the interest costs 
to decarbonisation targets. The SLB 
performance targets will be next tested 
for the period from 1 July 2025 to 
31 December 2025, with nominated 
divisions currently on track and expected 
to meet their targets.

operational and value 
chain emissions.Strategy 
The Group’s response to climate change aligns with our purpose and focus  
on long-term value creation.
Consistent with Wesfarmers’ model of divisional autonomy, each division has developed a strategy reflecting its unique emissions 
profile and climate-related risks and opportunities. Decarbonisation strategies and pathways to build climate resilience vary across 
our divisions given the different sectors in which they operate. 
Climate-related risks 
and opportunities 
Our businesses are exposed to climate-
related physical and transition risks 
and opportunities.
In 2025, we strengthened the 
integration of climate-related risks 
and opportunities into the Wesfarmers 
Risk Management Framework and 
corporate planning process. 
The Wesfarmers Risk Management 
Framework provides a consistent 
methodology for identifying, assessing, 
managing and reporting risks across the 
Group, with oversight from the Corporate 
Office, supported by divisional governance 
structures. The Group’s Risk Appetite 
Statement explicitly includes climate-
related risk and was last reviewed and 
approved by the Wesfarmers Board in 
May 2025. Risks are reported and 
monitored through divisional and Group 
audit, risk and compliance committees 
and boards.Climate-related risks and opportunities 
are considered by each division as part 
of the annual corporate planning and 
budget processes. This requires divisions 
to forecast emissions and consider 
strategies and investments to meet 
decarbonisation targets. 
Physical risks
Physical risks may be acute (such 
as from floods or fires) or chronic 
(such as sea level rise and sustained 
temperature increases). 
In recent years, Wesfarmers’ operations 
and the communities in which we operate 
have been impacted by an increase in 
the frequency and intensity of extreme 
weather events, such as flooding, 
extreme heat, fires and storms. In some 
instances, these events have led to 
property damage, operational and supply 
chain disruptions, and impacts on stores, 
team members, customers and local 
communities. Transition risks
Transition risks are driven by changes 
in global and domestic policy, regulation, 
technology, markets and community 
expectations. Our businesses operate 
in diverse sectors of the economy and 
their exposures vary depending on the 
emissions intensity, business model, 
geographical footprint and value chains 
of each business. 
Opportunities
The shift to a low-emissions economy 
presents opportunities for growth, 
including participating in new industries 
such as critical minerals like lithium, and 
entry into new markets through customer 
offerings within our retail businesses. 
There may also be adjacent opportunities 
that support the energy transition and 
products and services that support 
a circular economy.
