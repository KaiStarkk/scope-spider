In FY23, Cromwell Property Group made significant strides 
in our ESG journey. 
We developed and commenced implementation of our 
updated ESG Strategy; we prepared our globally-aligned 
approach to decarbonising the business to meet our targets 
of net zero scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2035; and scope 1, 2, 
and 3 emissions by 2045. For the first time, we have reported 
a comprehensive scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions inventory 
that covers emissions that arise from our upstream and 
downstream activities, including tenant activities; funds 
under management; joint ventures; and embodied carbon 
sources. This activity is supported by emissions abatement 
cost modelling for our Australian and European portfolios to 
facilitate emissions reductions and associated  
decarbonisation costs. 
The initiation of an electrification upgrade at our McKell 
building in Sydney’s CBD marked an exciting milestone 
in Cromwell’s journey towards decarbonisation. 
Simultaneously, our property team demonstrated leadership 
in ESG considerations within refurbishment projects 
– this involved striving for innovation in ESG practices 
and implementing subcontractor diversity, equity and 
inclusion targets. Our Italian team’s collaboration with AGC 
Glass Europe, a low-carbon glass manufacturer, further 
demonstrates our commitment to sustainable partnerships 
and reducing our embodied carbon. 
Our release of the Group Sustainable Finance Framework 
and initiation of green loans will help ensure we deliver 
on our targets and support in advancing ESG within the 
commercial property sector. This commitment culminated 
in our endorsement of the UN Principles for Responsible 
Investing (UN PRI), which aligns our business success with 
global sustainability. In FY23, we elevated our alignment 
with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure 
As we set our sights on FY24, we are 
eager to deepen our dedication to ESG
Executive update
(TCFD) recommendations, including committing to 
conducting a comprehensive gap analysis and charting a 
TCFD roadmap to ensure full alignment by 2025. 
In committing to creating a more inclusive workplace, we 
launched the Respect@Cromwell framework in Australia, 
which prioritises the prevention and early intervention 
of sexual harassment. Our global diversity, equity and 
inclusion (DEI) targets have yielded notable achievements, 
with four out of five levels within the Australian team 
achieving the 40:40:20 gender diversity goal. Progress 
was also made in Europe, increasing the representation of 
women in leadership positions to 36% by the end of FY23. 
Our membership in the Diversity Council of Australia and 
the introduction of new and inclusive leave benefits further 
support our DEI commitments.
Throughout the year, we dedicated our efforts to supporting 
more than 20 community organisations worldwide through 
volunteering and donations, further emphasising our 
commitment to giving back to the communities we serve.
As we set our sights on FY24, we are eager to deepen our 
dedication to ESG; to build on the foundation that we have 
established in FY23. We understand that progress often 
involves challenges and requires ongoing dedication, and 
we are committed to transparency and responsibility as we 
move forward.

Cromwell supports the goals of the Paris Agreement to limit 
global warming to 1.5°C, curbing the most severe impacts of 
climate change. As described by the International Energy Agency, 
the operations of buildings account for 30% of global final energy 
consumption and 26% of global energy-related emissions. 
We recognise that our sector has a significant role to play in 
decarbonisation and have set ambitious net zero targets and a robust 
strategy to support the rapid decarbonisation of our sector. 
During the year, we set an emissions reduction target aligned to the 
Science Based Targets initiative: 
Achieve 42% scope 1, 2 and 3 
emissions reduction by 2030 
against a 2022 baseline.  
The Science Based Targets initiative recently released draft guidance 
for the buildings sector. We will validate our target against these 
criteria. 
Marginal abatement cost curves (MACC) were developed for our 
Australian and European portfolios to identify emissions reductions and cost associated with decarbonisation initiatives that we could 
undertake. We conducted net zero prioritisation workshops with our 
funds and property teams to validate the findings from the MACCs, 
categorised the chosen initiatives into easily accomplished tasks and 
major projects, and plotted them onto a net zero roadmap. 
For our property investment portfolio, we conduct technical building 
assessments every three years, to ensure we maintain our assets 
at a high efficiency. Strategic asset plans include the analysis of 
climate change scenarios, sustainability objectives, and the physical 
and transition risks and opportunities. Cromwell’s focus on the 
acquisition and uplift of existing buildings lightens our carbon 
footprint. Our embodied carbon is largely attributed to maintenance 
and refurbishment. During our property lifecycles, we aim to serve as 
responsible stewards of our buildings; to improve the environmental 
efficiency and performance of these buildings before divestment. 
We commission energy and water audits of our property investment 
portfolio to identify opportunities for efficiencies. Within Australia, 
Cromwell uses the National Australian Built Environment Rating 
Scheme (NABERS) to assess the efficiency and environmental 
performance of our office buildings. NABERS compares our buildings 
against others. NABERS’ energy ratings measure the efficiency of 
an office building. An energy rating works by comparing the energy 
consumption of a building against a set of benchmarks that has been 
developed using actual data and identifies opportunities to save energy. FY23 PROGRESSTARGETRenewable energy use

Following the development of our net zero strategy, we have shifted 
our focus to asset-level decarbonisation. In FY24, we will undertake 
assessments at specific sites to identify emissions sources and 
create bespoke emissions reduction plans to reduce these emissions, 
while working in partnership with our service providers. The 
initiatives will also support the increase of the energy efficiency of 
our properties.
In addition to decarbonisation, we are reviewing standard leasing 
terms and conditions to introduce a schedule of sustainability 
initiatives. This will allow us to collaborate with tenant-customers 
to agree and achieve ESG targets. Cromwell currently has leases 
with “green” clauses in Australia for several government-tenanted 
buildings. These leases require Cromwell to uphold NABERS energy 
and water ratings targets, reduce base building energy, and water 
use and provide suitable metering and waste management for 
tenant-customers. 
In Europe, green leases allow us to collaborate more closely with 
tenant-customers to obtain environmental data and collaborate on 
joint sustainability initiatives, such as jointly funding energy efficiency 
upgrades, or installing and purchasing renewably sourced energy. 
26 percent of leases for Cromwell European Real Estate Investment 
Trust (CEREIT) meet this classification and more will be rolled out in 
FY24.FY23 NABERS Energy Rating: 5.3 Stars
for properties under operational control in Australia
Working with our tenant-customers in this way encourages 
sustainability and accountability. Our goal is to incorporate 
governance measures to influence our tenant-customers to 
introduce sustainability practices that reduce their scope 3 
emissions, helping to meet our net zero scope 1, 2, and 3 targets 
by 2045.
Every owned or managed property in our portfolio has a capex 
plan that is updated annually to address plant, equipment, building 
fabric, refurbishments and waste, and energy and water efficiency 
improvements. Decarbonisation

We further developed our net zero strategy in FY23 to 
better understand and leverage our progress to date, 
to identify gaps and to develop a baseline emissions 
inventory. For the first time in FY23, we are reporting 
against a comprehensive scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions 
inventory that includes estimates and methodologies 
for calculating emissions across all 15 categories of 
scope 3 emissions in line with the Greenhouse Gas 
Protocol. (see our ESG Data Pack). 
Improving the calculations of our emissions data 
means this year’s results are not comparable to 
those in previous years, or to similar organisations 
that are not reporting the full value chain. 
For example, our inventory is representative 
of emissions throughout our upstream and 
downstream activities, including tenant-customers, 
funds under management, joint ventures, and all 
sources of embodied carbon.FY23
