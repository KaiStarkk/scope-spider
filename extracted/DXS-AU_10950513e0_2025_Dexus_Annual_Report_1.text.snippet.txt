3.  Unlocking deep 
sector  expertise
With our executive team now fully in 
place, we are well-positioned to drive 
performance across both sectors 
and funds. 
Our cross-sector expertise is 
exemplified by the acquisition of 
41 George Street, a B grade office 
building in Brisbane’s CBD that we 
are repurposing into a modern, 
purpose -built student accommodation 
facility. Leveraging the full breadth 
of our Platform – from office 
redevelopment and opportunistic 
investing to infrastructure expertise in 
the Australian student accommodation 
sector – we are delivering strong 
outcomes for our funds, DREP1 
and DREP2. 
Another example is the delivery of 
the new national archival building 
for the New Zealand Government in 
Wellington, delivered through a turnkey 
Public Private Partnership (PPP) that 
leveraged office development expertise 
to create a state-of-the-art facility for 
a long -term government partner.
Sustainability
We focus on our sustainability priority 
areas where we can make the greatest 
impact: Customer Prosperity, Climate 
Action and Enhancing Communities.
Dexus continued to maintain net zero 
emissions across Scope 1, 2 and some 
Scope 3 emissions1 and procure 100% 
of electricity from renewable sources 
for the managed  portfolio.
This year, we released our updated 
Climate Transition Action Plan, 
outlining our strategy for managing 
climate -related risks and opportunities 
and advancing a low-carbon 
future. We are also well progressed 
in preparation for the Australian 
Sustainability Reporting Standards from 
FY26. Dexus continued to be recognised 
for its strong sustainability performance, 
ranking third among REIT peers and in 
the top 5% globally in the S&P Global 
ESG Index. 
Dexus and a number of funds also 
achieved global recognition in 
the GRESB 2024 Real Estate and 
Infrastructure Assessments. Customer satisfaction remains strong, 
with a Net Promoter Score of +41 across 
the office, industrial and healthcare 
sectors (out of a range of -100 to 
+100) demonstrating our continued 
engagement on shared priorities 
such as climate resilience, waste 
management and mental health and 
wellbeing. Our national partnerships 
with Black Dog Institute and headspace 
raise awareness and help to reduce 
stigma associated with mental health.
We met our FY25 sustainability targets 
and improved employee engagement 
to 68%, up seven percentage points 
from FY24. 
This result reflects our commitment to 
fostering a supportive and engaging 
work experience that empowers our 
people to thrive and contribute to our 
collective  success.
Our commitment to inclusion and 
diversity delivered initiatives focused 
on gender equity, LGBTQ+ inclusion 
and reconciliation. We are focused 
on addressing the gender pay gap, 
and while we are encouraged by our 
progress in gender pay gap data, we 
recognise we operate in a sector where 
it remains an ongoing challenge for 
both our organisation and the industry 
to achieve gender equity. Further 
details relating to our sustainability 
performance can be found on 
pages  52–83.
Governance
Our governance and risk 
management  practices are supported 
by well -established frameworks, 
processes and policies, which we 
continue to review and strengthen 
to ensure they remain robust.
Our Board comprises seven 
non-executive directors and one 
executive director. We are committed 
to maintaining diversity across 
gender, skills and experience. At the 
Annual General Meeting (AGM) held 
on 30 October 2024, Peeyush Gupta 
AM was appointed as Independent 
Director. Warwick Negus, Chair of the 
Board since 2022, and Mark Ford were 
re-elected as independent directors.
In response to the strike against the 
2024 Remuneration Report, the Board 
engaged extensively with proxy 
advisers and investors. Following these consultations, we have 
adopted a ‘back-to-basics’ approach 
to remuneration and proposed changes 
to the Long -Term Incentive (LTI) 
Plan, including a return to traditional 
performance rights measured over 
a three-and four-year period and 
an increased importance on TSR.
Further details on the Board and 
our governance practices can 
be found on pages 84–91 of this 
report, and in our Corporate 
Governance Statement available at 
www.dexus.com/corporategovernance .
Summary and outlook
We invest for the long term, and despite 
market challenges over the past few 
years, we are now past the inflection 
point with valuations for quality assets 
turning positive in the second half. Now 
is an attractive time to invest in real 
assets. We expect the next phase of 
the cycle to be driven by fundamentals, 
and our platform of high-quality assets 
and deep expertise positions us well 
to deliver for our Security holders 
and clients.
Barring unforeseen circumstances, for 
the 12 months ending 30 June 20262, 
Dexus expects:
 –AFFO of 44.5–45.5 cents per security
 –Distributions of 37.0 cents per security
On behalf of the Board and 
management, we extend our 
sincere thanks to our people across 
Australia and New Zealand for their 
commitment and contribution to this 
year’s result. We also thank our funds 
clients and partners for entrusting us 
with the management of their real 
asset investments, and our customers 
for their  continued loyalty.
Importantly, we thank you – our 
investors – for your ongoing support. 
We look forward to continuing to deliver 
sustained performance.

  Board focus
In FY25, the Board Sustainability Committee met six times, discussing climate-related issues at all meetings, including:
 –Endorsing the CTAP for Board approval
 –Oversight of net zero transition, climate risk management 
and resilience assessments –Monitoring progress on our energy intensity 
reduction  target 
 –Addressing climate risk and compliance with ASRS 
requirements through joint sessions with the Board Risk 
Committee and Board Audit Committee We consider physical 
and transition risks and 
opportunities posed by 
climate change in our real 
estate and infrastructure 
assets and operations, and 
how these influence our 
ability to create value for 
our stakeholders.
Climate aspirationsIn June 2025, we released our 
Climate Transition Action Plan (CTAP), 
outlining our continued approach to 
addressing climate change through 
decarbonisation, resilience and 
adaptation and transition investment.
 The CTAP uses scenario analysis to 
assess climate-related physical and 
transition risks and opportunities from 
now until 2050 and sets our strategy to 
address  them. This includes the introduction of 
three new climate aspirations for the 
Dexus Platform and key programs 
we will implement to support their 
achievement. Collectively, these 
aspirations define our strategic direction 
and climate action pathway to 2050.
We are well positioned to meet 
mandatory climate-related reporting 
requirements under the Australian 
Sustainability Reporting Standards 
(ASRS). This will be achieved through 
disclosures in our Annual Report and 
supplemented by current and evolving 
disclosures in our CTAP, Sustainability 
Data Pack and Management Approach 
and Procedures.
See Metrics and targets for more information on our aspirations on page 72.

Board governance and oversight of 
climate-related issues
The Board Sustainability Committee 
(BSC) is responsible for overseeing 
climate issues alongside broader 
sustainability-related matters. Where 
relevant, the Board and other Board 
committees, including the Risk, 
People and Remuneration and Audit 
Committees, will also consider or 
endorse climate-related decisions, 
including climate-related remuneration 
structures, climate risk management, 
upcoming assurance requirements and 
climate-related  disclosures. 
To ensure effective oversight of 
climate -related risks and opportunities 
the Board undertakes both 
climate -related and other education 
through biannual Director's forums 
and additional sessions as required. 
In the past two years this has included 
sessions on ASRS requirements, false 
claims and greenwashing and an 
introduction to the Dexus Sustainability 
Academy, deepening the Board's 
understanding of climate regulations 
and the Dexus sustainability strategy. Sustainability, including climate 
change and climate-related risks and 
opportunities, has been identified as a 
key skill, expertise and experience area 
for the Dexus Board. 
This year, our climate risk analysis 
and assessments were reviewed and 
discussed jointly by the BSC and 
the Board Risk Committee. The BSC 
considered our risk assessments 
alongside analysis of commercial 
drivers such as net present value, rent 
and occupancy to understand the 
potential operational and financial 
impacts presented by physical and 
transition climate risks to Dexus. This 
discussion supported the BSC’s decision 
making and approval of our climate 
aspirations and programs detailed in 
the CTAP. Climate considerations 
and remuneration 
Dexus’s commitment to climate and 
sustainability matters includes the 
inclusion of sustainability performance 
measures in remuneration for all 
employees. Sustainability measures 
make up 20% of the Group balanced 
Scorecard, which determines short term 
incentive outcomes for all employees. 
The measures in FY25 included 
Dexus’s performance in the GRESB 
sustainability benchmark and the 
delivery of sustainability commitments, 
including maintaining net zero on Scope 
1, 2 and some Scope 3 emissions1 and 
delivering our FY25 energy intensity 
reduction target. Sustainability and 
climate considerations are also 
embedded into key executive variable 
remuneration, through relevant 
performance  measures.
The remuneration report details 
Dexus’s remuneration strategy and 
how climate-related considerations 
among other financial and 
non-financial measures are factored 
into executive remuneration. For more 
information, see pages 92–121 of the 
Remuneration  Report. 
The table below includes Dexus’s key metrics, goals and targets used to track our climate performance.
