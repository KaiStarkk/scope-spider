Iren Group | Annual Report 2024
General basis for the preparation of the Consolidated
Sustainability Statement and disclosures in relation to
specific circumstances
"[BP-1_01, BP-1_02, BP-1_03, BP-1_04, BP-1_05, BP-1_06, BP-2_01, BP-2_03, BP-2_04, BP-2_05, BP-2_06, BP-2_07, BP-2_08, BP-2_09, BP-2_16,"
BP-2_17]
Iren Group’s Consolidated Sustainability Statement has been prepared on a consolidated basis in accordance with Legislative
"Decree  no.  125/2024  implementing  Directive  2022/2464/EU  (Corporate  Sustainability  Reporting  Directive (CSRD),  and  in"
compliance with the European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS) for the period 1 January 2024 - 31 December 2024.
"This Statement is the first to be prepared in accordance with ESRS standards, in place of the previous Consolidated Non-"
"Financial Disclosure prepared in accordance with GRI standards. Therefore, in view of the possibility of making use of the"
"phase-in measures provided for the first year of reporting, no comparative data have been presented."
The scope of the Consolidated Sustainability Statement is the same as that for the Consolidated Financial Statements: all
fully consolidated legal entities are included and are indicated in the List of Fully Consolidated Companies in the “Annexes to
the Consolidated Financial Statements”. It should be noted that no operational control was identified for any of the Group’s
investees.
"This Consolidated Sustainability Statement does not include any additional information from applicable legislation, with the"
exception  of  the  information  required  by  the  European  Taxonomy  (Art.  8  of  Regulation  (EU)  no.  2020/852)  (see  chapter
European Taxonomy in section Green Transition).
"Iren Group’s Consolidated Sustainability Statement considers the entire value chain, thus including information on upstream"
"and downstream segments when relevant. In particular, the upstream segment of the value chain includes first-tier suppliers"
"and investees, assessing impacts, risks and opportunities related to the sustainable supply chain management approach"
"adopted, while the downstream segment includes different types of customers and investees. The value chain information"
includes quantitative metrics on Scope 3 emissions for each significant category (see paragraph “Scope 3 GHG emissions”
"in chapter Meeting the challenge of climate change), qualitative information on relevant impacts, risks and opportunities (see"
"paragraph “Double materiality assessment” in chapter Strategy for sustainable development) and related policies, actions"
"and  targets.  For  the  reporting  of  Scope  3  GHG  emissions  related  to  the  supply  chain,  methods  aligned  with  the"
recommendations  of  the  GHG  Protocol  were  used:  partly  Scope  3  emissions  were  calculated  through  direct  access  to
"supplier emission data, partly they were calculated through a spend-based approach using sectoral emission factors. As part"
"of its commitments to sustainable supply chain management, the Group aims to increase as much as possible the proportion"
"of  scope  3  emissions  calculated  using  direct  data,  in  order  to  carry  out  monitoring  increasingly  linked  to  the  actual"
"performance of suppliers, through the gradual extension of data collection directly from suppliers."
Iren  Group  mainly  uses  quantitative  data  derived  from  its  management  systems  and  standardises  the  calculation  of
emissions through the use of emission factors derived from authoritative scientific and institutional sources. In cases where
"the use of estimates is necessary, these and the underlying assumptions are based on historical data, recognised regulatory"
"or scientific methodologies, which are deemed to provide soundness and reliability. Detailed information on any estimates"
used  can  be  found  in  the  chapters  on  each  specific  disclosure  where  the  assumptions  used  and  potential  sources  of
uncertainty are also described.
"Iren Group did not omit any specific information on relevant issues relating to intellectual property, know-how, innovation,"
upcoming developments or matters under negotiation.
"In  order  to  provide  greater  comprehensibility  of  its  business  model  and  strategy,  the  Group  decided  to  supplement  the"
"reporting required by ESRS standards with entity-specific information, highlighted by the code “IREN_XXX” shown in grey."
Indicators and data on future sustainability investments that are based on the assumptions underlying the 2030 Business
Plan are included in the Statement. These include data on the green transition plan whose sources of uncertainty are related
"to regulatory and technological developments, changing market conditions also in relation to the geopolitical context, the"
development  of  climate  policies  and  possible  updates  in  the  measurement  methodologies  used. The  main assumptions
"used in the forecasts concern population development, municipal and special waste production, energy consumption trends,"
"deployment of emission-capture technologies and low-carbon fuels, and cost estimates for implementing the actions of the"
ecological transition plan.
"The time horizons adopted by Iren Group in line with its strategy are: short-term (up to one year), medium-term (up to 5 years)"
and long-term (more than 5 years).

The short-term variable remuneration is based on an MbO (Management by Objectives) system that takes into consideration,
"the Group’s main objectives relating to economic and financial performance (weighting 40%), the  main strategic projects",
(weighting 30%) and ESG factors (weighting 30%) through performance objectives linked to the priority areas of intervention,
defined in the Business Plan:,
•,"decarbonisation: reduction of the carbon intensity of energy production, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions, energy savings"
,"in production processes, emissions avoided from the recovery of waste managed;"
•,circular economy: increase of sorted waste collection rates in the local areas served and of waste to material recovery
,"treated in Group plants, production of biomethane from biodegradable waste and reuse of purified water;"
•,"water resources: increase of purification capacity in the local areas managed, reduction of water withdrawals from the"
,"environment for distribution, reduction of leakages and division into districts of the aqueduct network;"
•,"resilient cities: extension of district heating, increase of environmentally friendly vehicles in the corporate fleet, green"
,"electricity sold to retail customers, energy savings from products/services offered by the Group;"
•,"people: increase in recruitment, under 30 hires, training hours per employee, people evaluated on performance, quota of"
,"female managers, accident incidence rate and coverage of employees with supplementary health care."
These objectives are also cascaded down to Company managers.,

=== Table 4 (page 122) ===
"(weight: 25%). For each economic-financial objective, a threshold level has been defined, equal to 90% of the target as defined,",
below  which  no  disbursement  of  the  linked  premium  will  be  made.  An  overall  threshold  level  has  been  defined  for  the,
"Sustainability/ESG objective, equal to 70% of the defined target, below which no disbursement of the related bonus portion",
is envisaged. The ESG composite target considers:,
•,enhancement of gender diversity (percentage of women executives and junior managers out of total executives and
,junior managers);
•,circular economy (increased sorted waste collection in legacy regions);
•,water resources (reduction in water network losses);
•,resilient cities (energy savings from Group products/services);

T,"he  methodologies,  significant  assumptions  and  emission  factors  used  to  measure  Scope  3emissions  are  summarised"
below:,
•,"category  1  (purchased  goods  and  services),  category  2  (capital  goods),  category  4  (upstream  transportation  and"
,"distribution) and category 8 (upstream leased assets): the methodology for calculating emissions was updated in 2024,"
,"supplementing the spend-based methodology (turnover from suppliers) with a supplier-specific approach. In fact, for"
,"suppliers active on the Open-Es portal, the Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions declared by them are taken into account and are"
,weighted according to the percentage of their turnover towards Iren Group. For companies not registered on the Open
,"Es  portal,  turnover  in  the  year  is  analysed  and  emissions  related  to  each  type  of  goods  and  services purchased  are"
,estimated using the UK Government GHG Conversion Factors for Company Reporting (DEFRA) and U.S. Environmental
,"Protection Agency - Supply Chain Greenhouse Gas Emission Factors by NAICS-6, specific to each category;"
•,category 3 (fuel and energy-related activities - not included in Scope 1 or 2): emissions are calculated on the basis of
,fuel  and  electricity  consumption  used  by  the  Group  and  the  UK  Government  GHG  Conversion Factors  for  Company
,Reporting  (DEFRA)  Well-to-Tank  (WTT)  emission  factors.  These  factors  make  it  possible  to  quantify  the  emissions
,"associated with the extraction, processing and transport of purchased fuels and electricity. Emission factors are kept"
,constant and equal to the base year 2020 for the purposes of comparability over the years and monitoring of the target
,validated by SBTi;
•,category 5 (waste generated in operations): emissions are calculated on the basis of waste produced by the Group and
,emission factors from the Ecoinvent 3.7.1 database processed using the Simapro software;
•,category  6  (business  travelling):  emissions  are  calculated  by  the  Group’s  travel  agency  (which  manages  all  Group
,"employee travel), Cisalpina Tours, which has established a partnership with Rete Clima to analyse the environmental"
,"impacts of its customers. For the calculation of CO2 emissions, all services booked through the travel agency portal"
,"(plane, train, rentals, hotel) are considered."
•,"category 7 (employee commuting): from 2024 onwards, emissions are calculated on the basis of data from the Group’s"
,"home-work commuting plan, based on employees’ answers to a questionnaire concerning the kilometres travelled each"
,"day  to  get  to  the  office,  repartitioned  on  the  average  number  of  Group  employees. The  conversion  factors  used  are"
,derived from ISPRA’s database of average emission factors for road transport;

=== Table 10 (page 185) ===
Iren Group | Annual Report 2024,
•,category 11 (use of sold products): emissions are calculated on the basis of the volumes of gas distributed to end users
,"multiplied by the emission factor related to gas combustion, as published in the latest available update of the Italian"
,National Inventory Report by ISPRA;
•,category 13 (downstream leased assets): emissions are calculated based on rental and lease income and emission
,factors  from  UK  Government  GHG  Conversion  Factors  for  Company  Reporting  (DEFRA)  and  U.S.  Environmental
,Protection Agency - Supply Chain Greenhouse Gas Emission Factors by NAICS-6;
•,category 15 (investments): emissions are calculated by multiplying the revenue of investees not consolidated on a line-
,by-line basis (in proportion to the Group’s share of ownership) by the emission factors set out in UK Government GHG
,"Conversion  Factors  for  Company  Reporting  (DEFRA)  and  U.S.  Environmental  Protection  Agency 
-  Supply  Chain"
,Greenhouse Gas Emission Factors by NAICS-6.
,"For categories 1 to 13, listed above, data are reported for all the consolidated companies of Iren Group and non-consolidated"
,"investees that are part of the value chain, in relation to the type of activity considered by the category. Category 15 includes"
,issues by non-consolidated investee that are not part of the value chain.
,The following Scope 3 emission categories are not considered applicable:
•,"category  9  (downstream  transportation  and  distribution):  given  the  nature  of  the  activities  managed  by  Iren  Group,"
,"downstream transport and distribution activities by third parties are not relevant and therefore, if there are emissions"
,"relating to this category, they are included in category 4 (upstream transport and distribution), the calculation criteria for"
,which are the same as for category 9;
•,category 10 (processing of sold products): the sale of intermediate products requiring transformation processes is not
,"applicable for Iren Group, which is mainly active in the sale of services and energy commodities;"
•,"category 12 (end-of-life treatment of sold products): the sale of products is not relevant for Iren Group, which is mainly"
,"active in the sale of services and energy commodities. Consequently, Scope 3 emission category 12 is not applicable;"
•,category 14 (franchises): the Group does not operate any franchised business and therefore the issues arising from this
,category are not applicable.
,"It should be noted that the information regarding the Scope 1, Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions of the companies in the value"
,"chain may refer, if data for the year 2024 is not available at the closing date of this report, to the previous financial year,"
,assuming that the size of the business operated by these companies has not changed significantly. This ensures the use of
,the latest available data from the entities in the value chain. The reference period considered is always the full financial year
,"for all entities in the value chain, maintaining consistency and comparability of data used in the calculation of GHG emissions."
,This uniformity allows for accurate and reliable measurement of emissions along the value chain.
