As part of our proactive approach to reducing our 
environmental footprint, we continued working with 
sustainability and climate advisor, NetNada Pty Ltd 
(NetNada). Our focus is to minimise our direct and 
indirect GHG emissions across Scopes 1, 2 and 3 in 
line with The Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate 
Standard and in accordance with NetNada’s  
Carbon Neutral Business Standard. In FY25, we 
continued to measure our total emissions across 
Scopes 1, 2 and 3 and responsibly recycled e ‑waste 
in partnership with Zolo.Sustainability is sponsored by our Group CEO, 
overseen by our Board, and reviewed regularly  
by our Board sub committees and Executives.  
In FY25, we established an ESG Steering  
Committee to support cross ‑functional decision 
making and governance coordination, and  
continue to identify, manage and report on 
sustainability risks in accordance with our risk 
management policy, enterprise RMF and 
Board ‑approved risk appetite statement.
This year we achieved an increase 
to 40% women in leadership roles 
across the Group.

Zip continues to measure and manage its 
environmental impact and climate‑related 
risks, for the benefit of all our stakeholders. 
As a digital‑first company, our Greenhouse gas 
(GHG) emissions remain relatively low across 
Scope 1 due to no direct emissions from sources owned or controlled by the Company 
and Scope 2 due to our endeavour to select 
renewable energy across our offices. However, 
we recognise the important role we play in 
taking action on climate change and seek to 
continuously improve how we deliver on our 
environmental sustainability commitments.Environmental Impact
Carbon Neutral Objective
For the fourth consecutive year, we have taken a 
proactive approach to reduce our carbon footprint. 
In our approach to carbon neutrality, we offset  
our FY24 residual emissions through certified 
carbon credits, including restoration and 
generation projects verified under the Verified 
Carbon Standard (VCS) and registered under the 
Australian Government’s Emissions Reduction Fund 
(ERF). We invest in environmental projects that 
reduce future emissions and generate co ‑benefits aligned with the United Nations Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs). This is a process we  
will undertake for our FY25 Scopes 1, 2 and 3 
emissions in the coming months with the same  
aim of carbon neutrality, with support from our 
advisors. In addition to continuing to invest in 
carbon neutral and renewable energy usage  
within our offices, we will further explore and set 
appropriate decarbonisation targets in FY26.

Scope 1, 2 and 3 Emissions
We continued to work with our external advisor 
NetNada to assess our direct and indirect  
GHG emissions, to align with the GHG Protocol. 
Scope 1 emissions are direct emissions from  
owned or controlled sources (for example, owned 
vehicles or factories), which remain at zero.  
Scope 2 emissions are indirect emissions from the 
generation of purchased energy, which come from 
our office electricity usage. Scope 3 emissions are 
all indirect emissions (not included in Scope 2) that 
occur in the value chain of the reporting company, 
including both upstream and downstream 
emissions. For Zip, key categories of Scope 3 
emissions sources include purchased goods and 
services (for example, spend on digital marketing, 
technology vendors and professional services), 
business travel, and employee commute. 
Scope 3 emissions make up the majority of Zip’s 
carbon footprint. We are continuing to mature our 
assessment and measurement of Scope 3 
emissions in order to establish appropriate 
baselines for our business that will inform targets. 
In FY25, we also enhanced our vendor engagement 
process to include questions relating to 
sustainability matters and engaged with suppliers 
associated with the highest proportions of Zip’s 
Scope 3 emissions as part of our efforts to 
influence the indirect environmental impacts of 
our operations.
Employee Initiatives
Our employees continued to support environmental 
initiatives using paid community service leave  
for environmental volunteering initiatives such  
as local beach clean ups and establishing an 
employee resource group to identify emissions 
reduction initiatives and drive engagement  
and awareness across the business.  Zipsters also participated in our “work from home 
and employee commuting” survey to enable us to 
calculate and better understand carbon emissions 
contributions from this part of our value chain.
Climate Reporting
As part of our proactive approach to reducing the 
environmental impacts of our business, and future 
proofing our operations with climate change in 
mind, we continue to develop our climate adaption 
strategy and manage carbon emissions from 
across our value chain. This includes progressing 
our readiness for mandatory climate reporting 
under the Australian Accounting Standards Board 
(AASB) in FY26, the ARC increased its focus on 
climate‑related risks and reporting in FY25.  
We have undertaken a gap analysis of our  
current climate reporting against the incoming 
standards, developing a roadmap to address  
the gaps. Zip is preparing for third‑party limited 
assurance over FY26 emissions inventory  
in anticipation of future mandatory climate 
disclosures and undertaking a cross‑functional 
review of climate risks and opportunities as we 
progress towards developing a holistic climate 
adaptation strategy. We will provide an update  
on our progress on this work in the FY26 
Sustainability report.
To support our transparent disclosure of 
climate‑related reporting, we continue to  
complete the Carbon Disclosure Project  
(expected to be submitted in September 2025).
Circular Economy
We continued our e‑waste recycling partnership 
with Zolo, diverting e‑waste from landfill across  
our Australian offices.
