(1),FY23 GHG emissions values calculated using the Primary Industries Climate Challenges Centre (PICCC) and University of Melbourne’s
,Greenhouse Accounting Framework (GAF) for Australian Beef production and feedlots. FY24 and FY25 GHG emissions values calculated using
,"overarching guidelines: GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance, GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting Reporting Standard, GHG Protocol"
,"Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard, the National GHG Inventory and the National Greenhouse Accounts"
,Factors. FY24 and FY25 product carbon footprint was determined following the methods outlined in the ISO Standard 14067:2018.
(2),Restated FY24 metric in line with updated science and emissions calculation standards to ensure consistency in comparison between FY24
,and FY25.
(3),Restated FY24 metric following the identification of inaccuracies subsequent to release of the FY24 report in natural gas usage. This resulted in
,a 31% decline for the previously reported fuel consumption and a 30% decline in previously reported total energy consumption by the Company.
(4),"Restated FY24 metric following the updated calculator becoming available. In prior year, an estimate of ACCUs generated under the fourth year"
,"of the Beef Cattle Management Herd Project was required, due to Clean Energy Regulator calculator remaining unavailable. During FY25, a"
,"true-up of 27,602 units was recognised to align with the result through the updated Clean Energy Regulator calculator for the FY24 period."
(5),"In FY25, 23 of the 25 livestock carrying properties underwent LPA audits. Two properties did not receive LPA quality assurance certification"
,"covering FY25. While annual LPA audits are not mandated by regulation and are generally conducted on a random basis, AACo aims to have all"
,"properties audited annually by qualified AUS-MEAT auditors. However, the timing of audits is influenced by auditor availability, particularly"
,given the remote locations of our operations. Audits for the remaining two properties are scheduled for FY26.
(6),"A single corrective action request was issued by LPA auditors in relation to one property, concerning a minor administrative oversight involving"
,the transfer of cattle intake data between livestock system databases. The issue has been resolved by the Company and subsequently verified by
,the auditor.
(7),"A limited quantity of a trial product (1,872kg) outside of AACo’s main beef portfolio, was voluntarily withdrawn following the identification of"
,foreign matter within the packaging of a small number of units. An investigation found that contamination incidences were low (<0.22% of the
,withdrawn product).
(8),"Two of the six third-party processors were not certified under a GFSI-recognised program. For one of these processors, the Company"
,"commissioned an independent third-party assessment based on HACCP principles and the FSANZ Food Standards Code (Chapters 3 & 4), which"
,"the processor successfully passed. The other processor holds all legally required food safety certifications, including accreditation from Safe"
,Food Queensland. This metric reflects certification status only and does not indicate non-compliance with GFSI standards.
(9),Food safety corrective actions related to the commercial sale of AACo products.
(10) Restated FY24 metric following the identification of inaccuracies subsequent to release of the FY24 report.,
"(11) KPMG provided limited assurance over the FY25 TRIFR value (85.4) as noted in the Health, Safety & Welfare section of this report that",
,"underpins this percentage, and not the percentage itself. Assurance was not undertaken on the FY24 TRIFR value and percentage."
(12) Restated FY23 & FY24 figures to include the Managing Director and CEO.,
(13) The pastoral industry is one which relies heavily on a transient workforce. AACo employs a significant number of young people who come to our,
,team for short term employment periods.

,GHG Emissions Profiling Methodology,
,,"We engaged agricultural and environmental consultancy, Integrity Ag, to support us with calculating AACo’s GHG emissions profile."
,,The calculations utilise industry leading intellectual property that is relevant to AACo’s operational context and provides us with additional
,,"confidence for more robust disclosure of our Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions, which have been included within the scope of our limited"
,,"independent external assurance assessment. The below details form the basis of preparation of AACo’s GHG emissions calculations, with the"
,,"outcomes detailed in the GHG Emissions Inventory section on of this report, and in the metrics presented in the Sustainability Metrics table."
,GHG Accounting Standards,
,The GHG account is prepared using the following precedent documents:,
,,"1.   Australian National Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Inventory – referenced here as the National Inventory Reports (NIRs), for methods to"
,,"determine agricultural emission sources, and some model input data."
,,2.   Australia’s National Greenhouse Accounts Factors (NGAF) for applicable Scope 1 and 2 emission factors and/or calculation methods.
,,3.   GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance (WRI & WBCSD 2011) and GHG Protocol Scope 3 (WRI & WBCSD 2022) agricultural and
,,Scope 3 carbon account guidance.
,,These precedent documents are consistent with the recommendations of the ASRS where National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting
,"(NGER) methods are not practicable, which is the case for livestock-related emissions.",
,"The principles followed, as described by the GHG Protocol, are as follows:",
For personal use only,•,Relevance – Ensure the GHG inventory appropriately reflects the GHG emissions of the company and serves the decision-making needs
,,of users – both internal and external to the company.
,•,Completeness – All attributable and accountable emission sources included. Non-attributable and non-reported emissions are described.
,,A 1% materiality threshold was accepted (and not more than 5% in aggregate).
,•,Consistency – Methods have remained consistent to previous accounts unless scientific changes have occurred in the previous reporting
,,period. Calculation method or emission boundary changes have been based on new science and documented. Adjustments have been made
,,to previous accounts where appropriate or differences have been quantified if possible. This has been documented.
,•,Transparency – Clear disclosure and documentation has been maintained. Non-attributable and non-reported sources have been
,,documented and justified.
,•,Accuracy – Input data is verifiable. Calculations are verifiable. Uncertainty has been noted where this can be quantified.
