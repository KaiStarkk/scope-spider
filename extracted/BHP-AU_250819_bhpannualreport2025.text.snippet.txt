9.8 Climate change
We believe the warming of the climate is unequivocal, human influence is 
clear and physical climate-related impacts are unavoidable. We recognise 
the role we play in supporting the net zero transition the world must make.

Our disclosures and approach to reporting
Climate Transition Action Plan
In August 2024, we published our second Climate Transition Action 
Plan (CTAP 2024) that provides an overview of our climate change 
strategy, commitments, targets and goals and forward-looking plans. 
Our CTAP 2024 was approved by the Board, with its development and 
ongoing implementation governed by the Board and its Committees and 
management. This OFR 9.8 updates certain aspects of our assumptions and 
plans since our CTAP 2024 and describes our progress in FY2025 against 
the strategy and our GHG emissions targets and goals, commitments 
and key metrics. The climate change targets and goals published in our 
CTAP 2024 are unchanged. Financial Statements note 16 ‘Climate change’ 
describes certain potential financial statement impacts, where material 
or relevant, of the assumptions, plans and actions of our climate change 
strategy and the consideration of climate-related risks in the assessment 
of significant areas of judgement and estimation in the financial statements. 
Our CTAP 2024  is available at bhp.com/CTAP2024

1. ‘Risks and opportunities’ is the language adopted in the TCFD recommended disclosures, while under our Risk Framework we regard ‘risks’ as comprising both threats and opportunities.
2. Refer to the updates in Pathways to our medium-term target and long-term net zero goal and Key changes to our projected pathway to our medium-term target and potential pathways to 
our long-term net zero goal since CTAP 2024 in this OFR 9.8.Given the global nature of our business, customers and supply chain, the 
development of our CTAP 2024 considered the goals of the Paris Agreement 
and the commitments and policy settings of relevant key jurisdictions at the 
time. Our global headquarters and some of our assets are located in Australia, 
which has a Long-Term Emissions Reduction Plan and legislated national 
targets to reduce Australia’s net GHG emissions to 43 per cent below CY2005 
levels by CY2030, and to achieve net zero GHG emissions by CY2050. 
We continue to monitor and take into consideration the evolving policy and 
regulatory landscape applicable to our operations as part of the periodic 
review by management and the Board of the appropriateness of and our 
progress towards our GHG emissions targets and goals.

9 Sustainability continued
1. There may be differences between our annual total operational GHG emissions inventory (unadjusted inventory) and the GHG emissions we measure for the baseline year, reference year 
and performance for our operational GHG emissions medium-term target and long-term net zero goal, resulting from different approaches to the treatment of divestments, acquisitions and 
methodology changes based on the purpose for which the data is being reported. –We also began studies and engagements to trial and test methane 
gas extraction techniques for our open-cut metallurgical coal mining 
operations with potential to reduce the fugitive emissions that occur 
when methane contained within and near coal seams is released during 
the mining process.
 –In FY2025, we continued construction of a boiler diesel displacement 
solution at Escondida, planned to commence operating in FY2026. 
This solution will replace diesel-fired boilers with a heat source 
(combining a thermo-solar and electric boiler solution) that does not 
generate any GHG emissions from operation of the boiler or generation 
of its electricity supply due to Escondida’s 100 per cent renewable 
energy PPAs. We also expect to commence construction of the same 
type of solution at Spence during FY2026. 
 –We also continued the operational trial of our first electric Liebherr R9400 
excavator at WAIO’s Yandi mine and increased our understanding of the 
potential changes to operations required for larger -scale deployments.  
 –We partially met our FY2025 social value scorecard Decarbonisation  
pillar milestone to ‘commence proof-of-concept trials for battery-electric 
equipment in collaboration with original equipment manufacturers’ through 
the preparation of the Caterpillar (CAT) Early Learner battery-electric haul 
truck trial, planned for commencement in FY2026. We expect delivery 
of the battery -electric locomotives in FY2026, followed by commissioning 
and the commencement of trials. These are important activities to enable 
our progress towards diesel displacement and the electrification of 
vehicles and mining equipment to continue despite broader delays in 
the development of diesel displacement technology, as discussed below.
 –In addition to our existing partnerships with Caterpillar and Komatsu, we 
have announced an exploration of opportunities with XCMG, CATL and 
BYD for the supply of electric mining equipment and the latest in battery 
technology for mining equipment, locomotives, light vehicles and battery 
storage systems.
 –In July 2019, we committed to establishing a Climate Investment 
Program (CIP) by investing at least US$400 million over its five-year life 
to scale-up low emissions technologies that can help decarbonise our 
operations, drive investment in nature-based solutions, and encourage 
further collective action on Scope 3 emissions. The CIP commenced in 
July 2020 and finished in June 2025. During that time, BHP spent more 
than US$400 million on decarbonisation projects across operational 
GHG emissions, value chain decarbonisation and climate-related 
BHP Ventures investments. 
Operational GHG emissions (Scopes 1 and 2 emissions 
from our operated assets)
Medium -term  
target: Reduce operational GHG emissions (Scopes 1 and 
2 emissions from our operated assets) by at least 
30 per cent by FY2030 from an FY2020 baseline.
Long-term 
net zero goal: Achieve net zero operational GHG emissions (Scopes 1 
and 2 emissions from our operated assets) by CY2050.

Overall
Long -term 
net zero goal: We have a long-term goal of net zero Scope 3 emissions 
by CY2050. Achievement of this goal is uncertain, 
particularly given the challenges of a net zero pathway 
for our customers in steelmaking and we cannot ensure 
the outcome alone.

For information on the essential definitions, assumptions, GHG emissions boundaries, measurement approach and adjustments for this medium -term 
target and these long-term net zero goals, including the potential use of offsetting, refer to Climate-related metrics, targets and goals in this OFR 9.8Climate-related governance
Climate change and climate transition planning is a material governance and 
strategic issue for BHP, our Board and management as described in OFR 9.2.

including risks (threats and opportunities) refer to our Corporate 
Governance Statement and Remuneration Report
Operational GHG emissions (Scopes 1 and 2 
emissions from our operated assets) 
Performance and highlights
 –Based on what we know today and using current methodologies for 
GHG emission accounting, we remain on track to meet our medium-term 
target to reduce operational GHG emissions (Scopes 1 and 2 emissions 
from our operated assets) by at least 30 per cent by FY2030 from an 
FY2020 baseline (baseline year and performance data adjusted; for 
more information on the adjustments we make refer to Climate-related 
metrics, targets and goals in this OFR 9.8). We have not used carbon 
credits or applied offsetting in our assessment that we are on track to 
meet our medium-term target. 
 –For FY2025, our operational GHG emissions were 36 per cent lower 
than our FY2020 baseline, a further 4 percent improvement against 
our FY2020 baseline compared to 32 per cent in FY2024 (baseline 
year and performance data adjusted). Operational GHG emissions in 
FY2025 were 8.7 MtCO 2-e, which is 5 per cent less than operational 
emissions of 9.2 MtCO 2-e in FY2024 (performance data adjusted).1 
Emissions reductions were largely driven by Western Australia Nickel 
operations going  into temporary suspension and ongoing Power Purchase 
Agreements (PPAs) in execution. For more information on the calculation 
of our operational GHG emissions data and energy consumption data refer 
to Climate-related metrics, targets and goals in this OFR 9.8.
 –Our total operational energy consumption decreased by 7 per cent 
from FY2024, largely due to the temporary suspension of Western 
Australia Nickel.
 –Our Chilean operations are on track to achieve 100 per cent renewable 
electricity use in CY2025, as they have each calendar year since CY2022. 
 –In FY2025, we signed a new seven-year PPA to achieve 100 per cent 
renewable energy at BMA from FY2027, based on forecasted operational 
electricity demand and when combined with another renewable PPA 
signed in 2023.
 –We commenced our planned drilling program at BMA during FY2025 to 
obtain a deeper understanding of methane quality and quantity (in both 
magnitude and density). This is earlier than outlined in our CTAP 2024 
(FY2026/27).40
