2.   Location‑based method: Location‑based emissions estimation methods are based on onsite consumption multiplied by industry
averages and typically do not reflect a company’s decision to purchase renewable energy or products calculates GHG emissions
based on the average emissions intensity of grids on which energy consumption occurs.
Market‑based method: The market‑based method of estimating Scope 2 emissions subtracts eligible renewable energy purchases
from the total quantity of purchased or acquired electricity that is not considered renewable before applying an emissions factor
to the residual electricity.
