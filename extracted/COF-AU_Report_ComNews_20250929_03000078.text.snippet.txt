Letter from the Chairman  
and Fund Manager
Dear Unitholders,
It is our pleasure to provide Centuria Office 
REIT’s (ASX: COF) 2025 Annual Report. COF’s 
long standing vision and strategy remains 
unchanged. We aspire to be Australia’s 
leading pure-play office REIT with a focus on 
generating sustainable and quality income 
streams and executing initiatives to create 
value across our portfolio of predominantly 
A-Grade office assets within metropolitan and 
near-city markets.
The outlook for the office sector is showing stronger indicators 
of market improvement including a stabilising interest rate 
environment, diminishing new office supply and a reduction 
in existing office stock, providing a backdrop to normalised 
vacancy and signs of improving tenant demand. This is 
particularly the case for metropolitan office where supply 
is becoming extremely constrained as office development 
feasibilities remain challenging, which we anticipate will  
drive market rents in the medium term. Office supply is  
further reduced with the rising trend of secondary assets  
being withdrawn for conversion to alternate uses, creating 
additional demand for displaced tenants. These trends bode 
well for existing A-Grade office landlords, such as COF, and 
reaffirm our optimism for the future of the metropolitan offices.
Despite this, leasing across the metropolitan office markets 
remained challenging during FY25 and has led to extended 
downtime on vacancies and continues to weigh on earnings, 
and leasing strategy remains a key focus as we move into FY26.
COF continues to provide investors with exposure to a young, 
geographically diversified portfolio of 19 high-quality office 
assets worth $1.9 billion1, providing a healthy 4.1-year WALE2 
and 91.2% occupancy3 (82% national occupancy4). Across the 
REIT’s portfolio, 93% comprise A-Grade office assets5.

COF delivered Funds From Operations (FFO) of  
$70.4 million1 or 11.8 cents per unit (cpu) and paid 
distributions of 10.1 cpu, in line with FY25 guidance.  
Gross property income decreased to $171.5 million, 
primarily due to asset divestments executed during FY24 
and higher portfolio vacancy. The average all-in cost of 
debt incurred for FY25 was 5.4%.
All portfolio assets were independently valued throughout 
FY25, with the like for like weighted average capitalisation 
rate expanding 31 basis points to 6.89% as at 30 June 
2025, reflecting net tangible assets (NTA) of $1.67 per 
unit2.  Most notably, an $18 million valuation gain was 
recognised in the second half, marking the first period 
of valuation growth since FY22 and 66% of portfolio 
revaluations increased or stabilised in June 2025, 
underpinned by an average 4% increase in adopted 
markets rents. 
Leasing
COF maintained a high volume of leasing during FY25,  
with 24,406sqm leased across 44 transactions, 
representing 8.9% of portfolio NLA3. Leasing activity 
extended to 16,985sqm of new leases and 7,421sqm  
of renewals. COF achieved 100% occupancy across  
its Western Australia and South Australia portfolios  
during the period and significant leasing secured in  
St Leonards and Docklands, collectively totalling  
more than  6,000sqm across 10 deals.
Additionally, portfolio rental growth averaging 4.5%  
year-on-year was achieved. The improved leasing 
momentum, valuation uplift and rental growth are a 
possible bellwether for emerging tailwinds, signalling  
the Australian metropolitan market may be on the  
cusp of a new cycle.
The REIT retains a staggered lease expiry profile, with  
70% of leases expiring at or beyond FY28, and strong 
tenant covenants with 75% of portfolio rental income 
attributed to government, multinational corporations  
and listed entities. COF has a diversified income profile 
with no single tenant expiry representing more than  
5% of portfolio income.Capital management
At the beginning of the year, COF completed an $862 
million loan refinance with existing lenders, resulting in 
beneficial outcomes such as renegotiated debt covenants 
including a 60% Loan to Value Ratio (LVR) and 1.75 times 
Interest Cover Ratio (ICR), extended debt duration to 2.5 
years, and no change to margin. 
COF maintains adequate liquidity with $141.5 million debt 
headroom4, a 3.1-year Weighted Average Debt Expiry 
(WADE) and no debt expiring before FY28. At 30 June 
2025, gearing was 44.4%5 and 81.5% of debt was hedged. 
Governance and sustainability
A number of key COF-specific ESG initiatives implemented 
during the year included: 
• Achieving a 5 Star NABERS Energy Sustainable 
Portfolios Index Rating6, which is aligned to the REIT 
targeting zero scope 2 emissions by 20287.
• Continued electrification across COF assets, with 
53% of the total portfolio electrified – including 
100% of QLD assets, which is aligned to targeting the 
elimination of gas and diesel in operations (scope 1) 
where practicable by 20358.
Further details of Centuria progressing its sustainability 
framework can be found in its sustainability report and 
climate-related disclosures, which are expected to be 
released by October 2025.
1. FFO is the Trust’s underlying and recurring earnings from its operations. This is calculated as the statutory net profit adjusted for certain non-cash and other items
2. NTA per unit is calculated as net tangible assets divided by closing units on issue
3. Includes Heads of Agreement and executed leases
4. Debt headroom is proforma and reflective of $100m in additional facilities post balance date.
5. Gearing defined as total borrowings less cash divided by total assets less cash.
6. NABERS SPI Energy Rating is for the period 1 June 2024 to 31 July 2025.
7. COF will account for zero scope 2 emissions by being powered by the equivalent of 100% renewable electricity through a combination of on-site solar and large scale 
generation certificate deals which match our consumption. The zero scope 2 target applies to scope 2 emissions for existing assets that fall under the operational 
control of COF.
8. COF will focus on eliminating gas and diesel where practicable, from equipment owned and operated by COF. Gas and diesel equipment owned and operated by our 
tenants, diesel used in back-up generators and refrigerants are excluded from Centuria’s emission reduction target.Centuria Office REIT         Centuria Office REIT
