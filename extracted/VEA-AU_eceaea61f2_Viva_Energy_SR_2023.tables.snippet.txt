"is	a	10%	Emissions	Intensity	reduction	(from	a	2019	base	year).	As	the	Emissions	Intensity	metric	is	calculated	both	on	aggregate	emission	reduction,	against	the	energy	produced	by	the	refinery	(see	page	23	for	a	further	description),"
"the	achievement	of	the	goal	is	subject	to	the	production	efficiency	and	operational	performance	of	the	refinery,	which	may	change	over	time.	As	such,	the	current	estimate	of	the	aggregate	reduction	required.	Reduction	required"

"likely	be	the	case	should	we	introduce	new	bio-	or	waste	processing	facilities.	In	such	a	circumstance,	we	would	expect	to	re-set	the	baseline	emission	for	the	facility	to	reflect	this	change,	which	would	impact	the	targets	set."
This is a decision we would take at the time of project commissioning.
