(1) Positive shift in female leader representation was not achieved due to IMDEX's small leadership cohort meaning any female leader's
departure disproportionately impacted the data. The FY26 target has been adjusted to measure total female workforce to better reflect the broader gender diversity across the business.
(2) The 'hands on steel' target was aligned with internal targets on the rollout of our ACTx tool, which requires less manual handling of drill
rods by a driller. While the rollout is progressing, it did not achieve the internal target of conversion of our core orientation fleet to ACTx globally.For personal use only

developed through extensive R&D to improve drilling efficiency and sustainability.
In Africa, a customer replaced four additives with xFORM L+, achieving an indicative 20% 
increase in metres drilled per shift, extended bit life, and elimination of hazardous chemicals 
and petroleum hydrocarbons. In the United States, another customer moved from a five-additive 
mud program to xFORM D+, improving core recovery from 40% to circa 95%, drill rates by 138%, 
and reducing downtime by over 70%.
xFORM demonstrates how IMDEX’s R&D pipeline is not just delivering new products, but 
reshaping mining operations — simplifying drilling, reducing environmental impact, and setting a 
benchmark for smarter, more sustainable mining.

Strengthening our greenhouse gas emissions data collection and measurement for Scope 
1 and 2 emissions across our global operations was a key focus in FY25.
In our data collection systems, we started work to upgrade existing software platforms to 
enhance accuracy and implement standardised protocols across global locations. Process 
improvements included establishing clear criteria for emissions categorisation and quality 
control measures for data verification. To build our capability, training is being provided to 
relevant personnel, alongside the development of standardised guidelines for  
emissions reporting. IMDEX is dedicated to minimising our environmental footprint and managing the impact of 
our operations.
We aim to conserve natural resources by reducing energy consumption, use water 
responsibly, minimise waste generation, and promote sustainable procurement practices. 
As IMDEX continues to grow, we recognise the importance of building a clearer picture 
of our operational footprint. We see an opportunity to better understand, measure, and 
manage our own impacts as part of the industry value chain.
In FY25, we began reviewing the data available across our global operations to better 
understand our current footprint and the gaps in measurement. This assessment 
highlighted where additional information and more consistent tracking are needed, 
providing the foundation to mature our approach to managing energy use, emissions, 
water, waste, and the lifecycle impacts of our consumables. 
Although still in early stages, these efforts mark an important step in our sustainability 
journey. A more complete view of our footprint will help us to prioritise actions that 
deliver meaningful reductions in emissions and resource use, align with best practice in 
sustainability reporting and disclosure expectations, and engage our people and partners in 
solutions that can have a tangible impact. Operational Footprint

IMDEX  FY25 Sustainability Report* Total emissions are presented using the location-based approach. Market-based emissions are also disclosed in line 
with the GHG Protocol’s dual-reporting requirements; however, these are not included in the overall total because market-
based emissions estimations were not available in all our countries and jurisdictions; therefore, location-based is the most 
comprehensive result to present.In FY25 IMDEX’s Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions were 2,831 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide 
equivalent (tCO2-e). This included 2,006 tCO2-e Scope 1 and 825 tCO2-e Scope 2 (location-
based). For FY25, IMDEX has also measured market-based Scope 2 GHG emissions which 
were 790 tCO2-e as an alternative method as recommended by the GHG Protocol Scope 2 
Guidance. 
In FY25 our GHG emissions increased by 674 tonnes from FY24. This increase is due to in 
part the addition of two new emissions sources captured in FY25: 
• Fugitive emissions: Refrigerants estimation (where possible) 
• Scope 1 mobile combustion: Fuel consumption from staff expenses and corporate 
expenses.
It is also due to the addition of inventory from our European operations and an increase in 
operational emissions from our North American operations, which accounts for 59% of our 
total emissions. 
Our Scope 1 GHG emissions include emissions from fuel used in company vehicles 
and refrigerants from our operations. Our Scope 2 GHG emissions are from purchased 
electricity.
We calculate our emissions for the reporting period in accordance with the Greenhouse 
Gas Protocol: A Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard (2004). IMDEX applies an 
operational control consolidation approach to define its organisational boundary for the 
purposes of calculating its GHG emissions. 
Further information about our reporting boundary and methodology for calculating 
greenhouse gas emissions can be found in Appendix 3. Greenhouse Gas Emissions
