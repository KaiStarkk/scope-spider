Our climate strategy contains two  
key elements: 
• reducing our net equity Scope 1 and

• investing in products and services 
for the energy transition.
These are depicted in the graphic

Highlights
Sustained demand:   
Customers 
committing  
to our LNG
• Emissions reduction and energy security are valued  
by our customers – LNG can help them meet both.
• We expect growth to be centred in Asia, and Woodside is 
advantaged to supply this demand.
• This is reinforced by firm demand side commitments to  
offtake, with over 15 Mt of LNG contracted to Asian buyers  
in the past 12 months.9,10,11New energy investment:   
$2.5 billion to date, 
with potential for 
1.6 Mtpa abatement16, 17 
• Investing in opportunities where we have strengths 
and see profitable demand.
• Beaumont New Ammonia Project acquisition  
has delivered material progress towards our  
Scope 3 targets.18
• Production of ammonia expected in the second half  
of 2025 with CCS expected to commence in 2026.2024 GHG emissions:   
14% below 
starting base13
• We delivered strong Scope 1 and 2 GHG 
emissions performance at our facilities, achieving 
the addition of Sangomar production whilst 
maintaining the portfolio within Scope 1 and 
methane emissions benchmarks.
• We are pursuing emissions reduction opportunities and 
are continuing to develop a carbon credit portfolio.
• We are on track to meet our net equity Scope 1 
and 2 GHG emissions reduction target of 15% by 
end of 2025.14,15

• Strong performance at facilities due to operational 
performance, resource quality and decarbonisation plans.
• Further net emissions reduction achieved from retiring 
carbon credits.
• Start-up of Sangomar added emissions as expected,  
whilst emissions intensity performance was maintained.• Woodside's methane performance is ahead of industry 
benchmarks and targets. Sangomar performance included 
one off emissions associated from start-up activities.
• Our methane plan is focused on advancing measurement, 
management, reporting, as well as supporting better 
regulation and practices across the value chain.
• We are a member of the flagship United Nations 
Environment Programme methane initiative – OGMP 2.0. • Woodside has better GHG emissions life cycle intensity 
performance than industry benchmark due to higher 
weighting of natural gas in our portfolio.
• Sangomar production had modest impact on this 
metric despite adding energy growth to portfolio. 
• Adding new energy products and lower-carbon services 
has potential to further reduce life cycle intensity.Woodside's emissions 
are lower than industry 
benchmarksBenchmarks used in the charts on this page are:
• Scope 1 and 2 intensity – the International Energy 
Agency’s 2023 global average for oil, gas and liquefaction, 
weighted for Woodside actual production in 2024.
• Methane intensity – the Oil and Gas Climate Initiative’s 
(OGCI's) 2025 target of well below 0.20%.
• Life cycle intensity – the Transition Pathway Initiative's 
most recent oil and gas sector mean, which is for 2023.

Examples of LNG contracts 
disclosed by Woodside Scarborough2020 2025 2030 2035
Construction Payback targeted within 7 years FID Target first LNG cargo
The sale of 25.1% of Scarborough equity to Japanese LNG buyers is evidence of their confidence in the demand for its products. In addition, 
Asian customers have also made long-term contractual commitments to Woodside LNG offtake, further evidence of the resilience of demand. 
Woodside carefully evaluates how much LNG to contract and how much to retain for flexible spot markets, balancing the benefits of derisking 
offtake with potential higher margins on the spot market. In the fourth quarter of 2024, Woodside sold 33.6% of produced LNG at prices linked 
to gas hub indices in the quarter (12.8% of total equity production), realising a 31% premium compared to oil-linked pricing. 2040

in the energy transition
Woodside is confident in sustained demand for our LNG in the decades to come.  
This is because of our competitive supply, the demand from our customers, 
and the flexibility of LNG supply to support countries as they meet energy 
security, affordability and emissions reduction goals.
Woodside's competitive supply22 Customers are securing Woodside’s LNG with firm long-term commitments 
Woodside has signed long-term LNG contracts which 
go beyond Scarborough's targeted payback period24
FOB Cost (Breakeven) Shipping CostWoodside's LNG supply is cost-competitive. For example, the 
Scarborough Energy Project is one of the most cost-competitive LNG 
projects under construction anywhere in the world for delivering  
LNG to Japan, due to a combination of production and shipping costs.23

Coal demand is continuing to grow in the Asia Pacific region and is driving global GHG emissions growth. Addressing this growth while maintaining energy security has been a priority for global 
climate and energy policy. In response to policy signals and technology improvement, renewables are growing quickly, especially in China. In addition to this growth of renewables, sustained use 
of natural gas can preserve energy security, support renewables by firming their intermittency and also directly replace coal where infrastructure allows. To illustrate the potential of this, in 2023 
coal-to-gas switching was the largest single driver of emissions reduction in the US power sector.33 As well as power generation, we also expect sustained use of natural gas in heavy transport and 
other hard-to-abate sectors. Sustained demand for LNG is part of the energy 
transition because for many customers it allows them 
to achieve energy security while reducing emissions 
overall and these are both important goals.Some express the view that coal has been largely displaced from the 
energy system and that the priority should shift to displacing gas.
Europe has reduced its coal consumption by more than two thirds 
since peaking in 1987. Over the same period, the Asia Pacific region has 
increased coal consumption by more than four times, replacing European 
coal consumption many times over.29MYTH

Avoiding and reducing emissions  
is part of our daily operation
Boil off gas compressor – seal vent modifications  
and technology trials
Modifying boil off gas compressor vents is an example 
of applying equipment redesign to reduce emissions.Power generator optimisation
Woodside engineers monitor performance data, including 
analytics which determine the optimal power generator mix 
for peak system operability and energy efficiency.Strong Scope 1 and 2 GHG 
emissions performance
Our resource quality, design of assets and focus on operational emissions 
management are delivering strong Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions results. 
2024 Scope 1 and 
2 GHG emissions
• Our net equity Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 
were 5,437 kt CO2-e, 14% below the starting base, 
on track to meet our 2025 target of 15%.34,35
• Our gross equity Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 
of 6,784 kt CO2-e, included emissions 
arising from the additional production from 
Sangomar. A portion of these were associated 
with initial start-up activity. The number of 
carbon credits retired was 1,347 kt CO2-e.
• Our gross equity Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 
intensity remained better than industry benchmark 
after accommodating Sangomar start-up.36
