Data Notes
1.  Included are EBOS Group Ltd and all its subsidiaries as disclosed in its 2024 Annual Report, but excluding (i) entities listed as investments in associates over which we don’t have full management control such as 
Animates NZ Holdings Limited, as well as acquisitions that occurred during the reporting year. TWC and HPS pharmacies over which we don’t have operational control are excluded but the head office functions are 
included.
2.  125 facilities are reported in FY25, 120 facilities have Scope 1 emissions, and all facilities reported Scope 2 emissions. 125 facilities include those that were opened or closed during the period. The number of facilities at  
30 June 2025 is 133. 
3.  Scope 1 includes fugitive gases and direct emissions from consumption of gas for domestic and industrial use such as fuel for material handling equipment, generators, water pumps and fire hydrants. The emissions 
factors used are based on the Australian National Greenhouse Accounts and NZ Ministry for Environment.
4. Electricity, natural gas and LPG has been calculated using billing data. Where there are data gaps, those have been estimated.
a. Estimated electricity ~4.8%
b. Estimated natural gas ~0.1%
5.  Location-based Scope 2 emission factors for NZ are sourced from the Ministry of Environment (2025). For Australia, factors are sourced from the Australian National Greenhouse Accounts Factors (2024) and for ASEAN 
and HK, factors from the International Energy Agency (2024). The decrease in emissions from electricity are due to updated emissions factors and increased solar generation.
6.  Market-based Scope 2 emissions factors for NZ are sourced from BraveTrace (https://bravetrace.co.nz/). For Australia, factors are sourced from the Australian National Greenhouse Accounts Factors (2024).  
For ASEAN and HK, the factors from the International Energy Agency (2024) were used as market-based factors were unavailable at time of reporting. 
7.  Certified Renewable Energy was purchased for all 10.02GWh EBOS’ electricity in NZ, and GreenPower for three LifeHealthcare locations in Australia. Certified Renewable Energy (NZ) and GreenPower (Aus) apply zero 
emissions electricity claims under market-based emissions reporting but not location-based.
8. 9 facilities have roof-mounted solar. As at 30 June 2025, the GLA of these facilities represent 27.9% of the Group’s total GLA.
9. Gross Electricity Consumed refers to all grid sourced electricity + solar generated and consumed onsite. This excludes solar electricity generated but then exported to the grid. 
10. Carbon Offsets in FY25:
a. EBOS acquired and retired 3,343 Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs) to offset Scope 1 emissions. Each ACCU represents one tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO 2e).
b. EBOS further acquired 20,088 tonnes of carbon offsets through a donation to Greenfleet to partially offset transport related emissions.
11. Scope 3 emissions are not disclosed. 
12.  Total Electricity Not Considered Renewable refers to the quantity of electricity purchased from the grid that is not considered renewable, as per the formula used to calculate market-based emissions.  
This includes any onsite solar consumed on site, where the renewable energy certificates owned by others have been sold. The total grid electricity is discounted by the RET Renewable Power percentage to account for 
renewable electricity cover under the LRET scheme. 
13.  Water consumption has been calculated using billing data. Where there are data gaps, consumption has been estimated. Water billing data is often not available as it is paid for by the landlord.
14.  Energy reduction target: EBOS has a 15% energy intensity reduction target covering all Australian and NZ Distribution Centres with 12 months of full operation. Based on FY25 data, the intensity has reduced by  
12.3% compared to the FY21 Baseline intensity of 86 kWh/m2 GFA. As reduction measures are implemented and new more efficient sites are onboarded, the intensity value decreases. In the last quarter of FY25  
(April-June 2025) some additional large new sites achieved full operation. As a result, the annual equivalent intensity reduction percentage improved to 13.8% for this quarter compared to the FY21 Baseline.
