17.  Provisions
Accounting Policy
Provisions are measured at the present value of expected future cash outflows with future cash outflows reassessed on a regular
"basis. The present value is determined using an appropriate discount rate. The obligations include profiling, stabilisation and"
"revegetation of the completed area, with cost estimates based on current statutory requirements and current technology."
Employee benefits
"Liabilities for wages and salaries, including non-monetary benefits, annual leave, vesting sick leave and redundancies expected to"
be settled within 12 months after the end of the period in which the employees render the related service are recognised in respect
of employees’ services up to the end of the reporting period. These are measured at the amounts expected to be paid when the
liabilities are settled. The liability for annual leave and accumulating sick leave is recognised in the provision for employee benefits.
All other short-term employee benefit obligations are presented as payables.
The liability for long service leave and annual leave which is not expected to be settled within 12 months of balance date is
recognised in the provision for employee benefits and measured as the present value of expected future payments to be made in
respect of services provided by employees up to the end of the reporting period. Consideration is given to expected future wage
"and salary levels, experience of employee departures and periods of service. Expected future payments are discounted using"
market yields at the end of the reporting period on a high-quality corporate bonds rate with terms to maturity and currency that
"match, as closely as possible, the estimated future cash outflows."
"Restoration, rehabilitation and environmental expenditure"
"Provisions are raised for restoration and rehabilitation expenditure as soon as an obligation exists, with the cost being charged to"
the Statement of Comprehensive Income in respect of ongoing rehabilitation. Where the obligation relates to decommissioning of
"assets and restoring the sites on which they are located, the costs are carried forward in the value of the asset and amortised over"
its useful life.
Safeguard Mechanism
Reforms to the Australian Government’s Safeguard Mechanism took effect on 1 July 2023. The reformed Safeguard Mechanism
"requires facilities with Scope 1 emissions of more than 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year to progressively"
reduce Scope 1 emissions against a determined baseline by 4.9 per cent per annum to 2030. The Group’s Bengalla Mine qualifies
as a covered production facility under the Safeguard Mechanism.
"Where actual emissions are in excess of the baseline for the period, a provision is recognised based on the quantum of excess"
"emissions. Where Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCU’s) are owned and will be surrendered to settle the liability, the cost base"
"of credits held is used in measuring the provision. Where sufficient credits are not owned, the provisions is measured using current"
market value of credits at reporting date.
Other provisions including legal claims
"The Group recognises a provision when: a) it has a present obligation, b) it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying"
economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and c) a reliable estimate can be made of the amount to settle the obligation.
If the Group has a present obligation arising from past events but d) it is possible rather than probable that an outflow of resources
"embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation, or e) the amount of the obligation cannot be measured with"
"sufficient reliability, the Group discloses a contingent liability."
