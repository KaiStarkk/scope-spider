Managing our 
own operations
Since 2013, AMP has been carbon neutral across our 
office operations by reducing scope 1 and 2 emissions 
and offsetting residual emissions arising from office 
buildings and scope 3 emissions from air travel.
In 2024, AMP reduced scope 1 and 2 emissions by 32% 
from 2023, which represents a total approximately 91% 
reduction from the 2019 base year. Emissions reductions 
continue to be driven by a consolidation of office space 
following moves to more efficient office buildings, 
increased use of renewable electricity in previous 
reporting periods and divestment activity.
AMP offsets its residual emissions with high quality 
Australian and international carbon offsets. In 2024, 
AMP achieves carbon neutrality across our operations 
by retiring Australian Carbon Credit Units (ACCUs) 
and Verified Carbon Standard (VCS) offsets from 
a range of removal and abatement projects.

Superannuation & Investments
Quantitative and qualitative approaches are used to assess 
and provide an understanding of the climate risks of the 
diversified portfolios managed by AMP Investments. In 2024, 
scenario analysis was carried out across key fund ranges for 
three climate scenarios, across two time frames, to evaluate 
changes in probability of achieving investment objectives.
AMP Investments also monitors the emissions profile of 
flagship portfolios against the benchmark, published on the 
AMP website. In addition, the investment team have added 
select forward looking characteristics, such as investee 
company (public markets) emissions targets to supplement 
our understanding of the climate risk profile of the portfolios 
we manage.
For example, in the MySuper 1970s fund, the largest MySuper 
cohort by AUM, approximately 63% of listed companies 
in the public markets portfolio were committed to climate 
targets including approved and unapproved Science based 
targets in 2024, compared to 60% in 2023. This baseline 
supports our investment teams to identify engagement 
opportunities through investor collaborations as outlined 
in the Responsible  investment section .Bank
To understand the emissions arising from financing activities, 
AMP Bank estimates the scope 3 emissions arising from its 
residential mortgage portfolio. In 2024, the scope 3 emissions 
estimated associated with lending was 127.5 kt CO2-e, with a 
Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) score 
of ‘5+’. This compares to 144 kt  CO2-e in 2023. Further detail 
on this methodology  and assumptions are outlined in the 
AMP  Bank financed emissions methodology document .
AMP Bank also has systems in place to monitor and assess 
natural hazard risks (e.g., flood and fire) of mortgage assets 
in the portfolio to understand proximity of any natural 
hazards to buildings and support communication with 
customers who might be affected.

Nature and biodiversity
Focus on nature and biodiversity continued in 2024, including 
recognition of the global economic dependencies and the 
intersection with climate change. 
Following the publication of the Taskforce on Nature-related 
Financial Disclosures (TNFD) in 2023, AMP is continuing to 
take steps to understand this emerging issue to effectively 
manage environmental risks and opportunities on behalf 
of our customers, people and communities.In 2024:
• AMP took part in several industry working groups and 
educational opportunities
• AMP Investments has requested external fund 
managers  provide evidence of their engagement with 
underlying investee companies, which included more than 
30 engagements specifically on biodiversity topics.
EFM Nature case study
In 2024, an AMP Super external manager engaged an airline 
on its Net Zero by 2050 plan and how it is approaching 
nature and biodiversity risks. The airline has set emission 
reduction targets, seeking reductions using Sustainable 
Aviation Fuel (SAF) and implementing operational efficiency 
improvements  such as airspace management, flight 
planning  and aircraft performance.
In addition, the company is investing in reforestation and 
farming projects that generate Australian Carbon Credit 
Units (ACCUs) to address residual emissions and support 
customers offsetting their travel impacts. The company has 
recently launched its first nature strategy and intends to set 
nature-related targets and commence TNFD reporting by 
FY2025. The manager  continues to monitor developments.
Future focus
• Comply with incoming climate-related reporting requirements in Australia, 
and improve  measurement and estimation methodologies on emissions over time
• Continue to engage with companies, assets and investor groups through 
investor  collaborations
• NZWM continues to focus on achieving its net zero emissions targets and also 
intends  to invest further into climate-related infrastructure investment opportunities
