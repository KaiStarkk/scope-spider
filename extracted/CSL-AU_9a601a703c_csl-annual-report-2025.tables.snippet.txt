Inherent Limitations
"Because of the inherent limitations of an assurance engagement, together with the inherent limitations of any system of internal control"
"there  is  an  unavoidable  risk  that  fraud,  error,  non-compliance  with  laws  and  regulations  or  misstatements  in  the  Subject  Matter"
Information may occur and not be detected.
Emissions quantification is subject to inherent uncertainty because incomplete scientific knowledge has been used to determine emissions
factors  and  the  values  needed  to  combine  emissions  due  to  different  gases.  We  specifically  note  that  CSL  has  used  estimates  or
extrapolated  underlying  information  to  calculate  certain  amounts  included  within  the  Scope  1  and  2  greenhouse  gas  and  energy
information.
"Additionally, non-financial data may be subject to more inherent limitations than financial data, given both its nature and the methods"
"used for determining, calculating and sampling or estimating such data."
Restricted use
The reporting criteria used for this engagement was designed for a specific purpose of reporting the Subject Matter Information presented
"in CSL 2025 Annual Report and the CSL 2025 Corporate Governance Statement, as a result, the Subject Matter Information may not be"
suitable for another purpose.
This report has been prepared for use by the Directors of CSL for the purpose of providing assurance over Selected Sustainability Metrics
and Disclosures presented in the CSL 2025 Annual Report and CSL 2025 Corporate Governance Statement. We disclaim any assumption
of responsibility for any reliance on this report to any person other than the Directors of CSL or for any purpose other than that for which
it was prepared.
Matters relating to electronic presentation of information
It is our understanding that CSL may publish a copy of our report on their website. We do not accept responsibility for the electronic
presentation of our report on the CSL website. The security and controls over information on the website is not evaluated or addressed
by the independent assurance practitioner. The examination of the controls over the electronic presentation of this report on the CSL
website is beyond the scope of this engagement.
