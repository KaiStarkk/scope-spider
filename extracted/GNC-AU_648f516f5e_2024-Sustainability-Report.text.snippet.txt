FY24 highlights
Financial
We delivered a resilient 
financial result in  FY24 amid  
mixed  Australian growing 
conditions and a weaker 
global  margin environment. 
Operational
Our people and assets performed 
strongly during the year with 
continued emphasis on  driving 
efficiencies across  our integrated 
value chain.
 
Sustainability
We continued delivering on 
our sustainability goals and 
recorded improvements in several 
key metrics across the business.  
Intensity metrics are measured per  unit of 
production/throughput tonne. They are  influenced 
by fluctuations in the annual volume of grain 
handled by GrainCorp, which is directly correlated 
to the size of the East Coast Australia harvest. 1. Underlying EBITDA is a non-IFRS measure representing earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation, excluding Business Transformation costs.
2. Underlying NPAT is a non ‑IFRS measure representing statutory net profit after tax, excluding Business costs after  tax.

We know that making progress across our priority 
sustainability topics requires a focus on action. 
In 2021 we set out a three‑year rolling roadmap  
that was designed to integrate sustainability 
considerations into our business processes. Our FY23 Sustainability Report detailed a set of commitments for  FY24 
that represent a shift to action. This next phase of our roadmap is 
focused on developing ambitious and realistic goals and targets that 
we can take action to deliver.11

As a company with processing 
operations and a large footprint of 
assets, our primary environmental 
impacts occur through our 
management of energy, emissions, 
water, and waste. 
This section discusses our progress in improving 
environmental performance across our operations in 
Australia and New Zealand. In relation to areas outside 
our operational control, GrainCorp continues to work with 
growers and producers, suppliers, and customers to create 
and support initiatives that have a positive social and 
environmental impact. For more information, refer to the 
Sustainable Agriculture and Nature, Climate, and Responsible 
Sourcing and Human Rights sections of this report.
GrainCorp’s Environment Policy and Energy Management 
Policy are available on our website and guide our approach 
to managing our environmental performance.
We note that the energy and water productivity, and 
emissions intensity ratios described in the charts to the 
right, are heavily influenced by fluctuations in the annual 
volume of grain handled by GrainCorp, which is directly 
correlated to the size of the ECA harvest. In  FY25, we  
will develop a methodology that enables more accurate 
illustration of data trends, through the use of normalised 
production data. We aim to provide Environment data in 
this format from FY25.Environment

metered mains supply. For ECA sites, 
a water consumption estimation 
methodology has been applied that

sample sites, to calculate a water 
efficiency ratio (kL/tonne). The  
estimation methodology applies to 
approximately 16 per cent of total

use includes metered water only.7. Calculated as volume of trade 
waste generated per production/

Our Approach
The environmental impacts of GrainCorp’s direct 
operations are managed through our Health, 
Safety and Environment (HSE)  Management  
System. This system sets out rigorous, consistent, 
company -wide standards for monitoring, 
reporting, auditing and continuous improvement 
of our environmental impacts. The HSE 
Management System is consistent with ISO14001  
and GrainCorp’s Australian processing sites 
at West Footscray, Numurkah, and Pinjarra 
and Auscol business, have used the system 
to achieve ISO14001 certification.

Submit Scope 1 and 2 emission  reduction  
targets and roadmaps to SBTi.
  Achieved        Partially achieved        OngoingOur operations are subject to multiple national and 
state -based environmental regulations. These range 
from managing localised issues such as noise and odour, 
to the reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and the use 
of chemicals. Thirteen of our sites, comprising six port 
terminals, three Auscol sites and four processing sites, 
hold environmental licences.
Environmental obligations, compliance (including compliance 
with a site’s environmental licence)  and risk are managed  
and controlled through site registers that reflect each 
site’s location and operating context. Each Site Manager 
is responsible for overseeing site -specific environmental 
management processes and employees are trained in 
the procedures for managing and reporting incidents. 
A dedicated team of environment professionals provide 
support and verification across GrainCorp, including the 
execution of an internal audit program. Twenty -six sites 
are included in  the internal audit register  and the 10 sites  
classified as high -risk are audited annually.
Our internal HSE Management System contains 13 
environment standards, focused on key environmental 
aspects, including water, waste, noise, air, and biodiversity 
management, that underpin compliance with local, state 
and federal regulatory requirements. Each year we report 
the Scope  1 and Scope 2 emissions from our  Australian  
operations under the Australian National Greenhouse and 
Energy Reporting Act 2007 and this data can  be found  here.
Certain chemicals are used across our food processing and 
east coast Australia (ECA) grain  handling sites in  line with 
food safety and export requirements. More information on 
our use of chemicals can  be found on pages 46 and 47.Environmental incidents including near misses are tracked 
through our incident management system, Sphera. This ensures 
the development and tracking of corrective actions, internal 
escalation and external notification where required. In October 
2024, GrainCorp Operations Limited was fined AUD$15,000  
after a system error resulted in a phosphine discharge at 
levels above licensed limited at Port Kembla in  March 2024.  
GrainCorp notified the NSW Environment Protection Authority 
(EPA) immediately upon  becoming aware of the incident and  
has since implemented a range of corrective actions and 
enhanced system controls to prevent any future occurrences.
Our focus on improving the environmental impact of 
our operations is supported by our proactive internal 
environment communication program. This program includes 
environment -focused Toolbox Talks, activities to recognise 
World Environment Day and regular updates through our 
internal communications platforms on the progress of projects 
related to our energy, emissions, water and waste impacts.
We monitor the environmental metrics appropriate to each 
business unit through that business unit’s relevant operational 
forum. In  FY24 we have embedded a GrainCorp wide  
environment dashboard into GrainCorp’s Health, Safety and 
Environment report that is provided to the Executive Leadership 
Team and Safety, Health and Environment Committee (SHEC)  
each quarter.Environment18
