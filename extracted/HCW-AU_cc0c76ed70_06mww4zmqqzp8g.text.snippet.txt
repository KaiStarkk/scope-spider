Notes: : Reported from Group level and as at 30 -Jun-25 unless otherwise stated.1. Pending external audit, based on a like -for-like asse t dataset across managed real estate funds; a) excludes assets where the tenant is responsible for electricity consumption 
and has complete operational control of the property; b) excludes assets that were held for sale and assets that were develop ed post -FY22; 2. Sites that are classified as feasible include assets where we have operational control, and the building 
infrastructure and architecture is suitable for the proposed sustainability initiative (solar and/or EMS). Feasible assets re present 32% of total owned HCW portfolio for solar roll -out & 16% of HCW portfolio for EMS roll -out.; 3. As at Jul -25. Eligible sit es with full 
information only, excludes assets with no operational control and assets acquired during the year. 4. Under recognised rating  tools some of our solar installations cannot be recognised in our calculations because the solar installations are operated by third 
part energy retailers. Sustainability update 
Real estate platform on track to achieve ~32% reduction in scope 1 and scope 2 emissions (vs 
FY22 baseline)
1 achieved through smart Energy 
Management Systems (EMS) and solar roll out. If we were to recognise the benefits of the solar roll 
out
4, treatment of the solar benefit (embedded 
networks allocation) and recognition of Energy 
Efficient Certificates –  the reduction in 
consumption compared to baseline would be 
~50%1
In FY25 across real estate, ~70% of feasible sites had solar installed against a target of 65%
