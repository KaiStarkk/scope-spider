We published our first 2030 Ambition Statement in last year’s 
report, which, though mostly qualitative, reflected our aspirations and commitment to sustainability. This year, we built on that foundation by making our ambitions more concrete and quantitative, based on our current results and plans as well as industry benchmarks. 
While we support the concept of a transition to a Net Zero 
economy, this year’s assessments have led us to revise our emissions reduction ambition to better reflect the current status of our strategy. As we intend to continue growing our business and number of restaurants in coming years, we foresee purchasing green energy in addition to the solar power generated by our own panels to reduce absolute emissions in our operations.  We plan to continue building on our climate data maturity - including scope 3 data - to better understand potential levers and solutions for limiting and reducing our total carbon footprint. As our climate transition plan matures, we will reassess the possibilities for aligning our emissions reduction to a Net Zero pathway.While in principle we have set targets that we believe are achievable, with effort, for some targets this requires efforts beyond our direct sphere of control. This particularly relates to achieving our Australian waste diversion target, which requires solving several infrastructural complexities together with our waste collection partners. 
As part of a franchise network, we do not have full control over 
all sustainability-related topics (such as packaging, sourcing of core products, and our menu offering – as these are provided by our Franchisor Yum! Brands). For these areas, we align with Yum! Brands’ 2030 ambitions, which are indicated with a Yum! Brands’ logo in the accompanying visual.

As a business operating nearly 400 restaurants and selling 
significant volumes of agricultural commodities, our emissions 
footprint is substantial. Simultaneously, our business model 
is highly dependent on a resilient food system – one that is 
increasingly impacted by the effects of climate change. As 
we begin to see more frequent and severe weather patterns 
and events, we anticipate increased risks for our business, such 
as damage to our restaurants and supply chain disruptions. 
Minimising our carbon footprint, while mitigating and adapting 
to climate risks, are therefore important components of our 
broader resilience agenda. 3.1 CLIMATE CHANGE
Reduce our scope 1 & 2 emissions 
by 30% compared to 2025 levels 2030
Ambition
Sustainable refurbishment of KFC Indooroopilly
As part of our franchise agreement 
with Yum! Brands, we remodel 
our restaurants every five years to 
ensure they remain fit for purpose 
and aligned with KFC and Taco Bell 
brand standards. Where possible, 
we combine these remodels with 
sustainability upgrades. In our 
recent KFC Indooroopilly remodel, 
we introduced several sustainable 
features alongside the restaurant’s 
existing solar system. These included 
low VOC paints, new planter beds 
made from sustainable materials, 
upgraded glazing to improve energy 
efficiency, and carbon negative 
saveBOARD wall linings made from 
upcycled shredded and compressed 
composite packaging. 
The visual below shows the high-level break down of our 
emissions footprint. We currently estimate that ~ 80% of our 
total emissions fall within Scope 3, primarily driven by emissions 
associated with food ingredients and their agricultural supply 
chains. Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions are predominantly driven 
by energy use in our restaurants. This chapter outlines our 
climate-related actions taken this year, our results, and actions 
we plan to take next year and beyond.

Supply chain emissions: As sourcing of most of our suppliers 
is coordinated by our franchisor Yum! Brands, our efforts to 
reduce Scope 3 emissions focus on collaboration with partners, 
suppliers, and other stakeholders to align on climate goals, 
cross-industry collaboration on pilot programs and joint ways to 
monitor progress. Progress in our supply chain thus far includes 
emission reduction targets for all our chicken suppliers, as well as 
the use of solar panels and LED lighting across supplier facilities, 
and a trial of an electric truck with one of KFC’s chicken 
suppliers. In Yum! Brands’ upstream supply chain there has been 
a 6% reduction in protein-related emissions per metric tonne of 
beef, poultry, dairy and packaging achieved since 20191. As we 
gain greater clarity on Collins Foods’ specific Scope 3 emissions 
footprint over the coming year, we will be better positioned to 
track progress and target our actions more effectively.
Alternative protein: We estimate emissions related to meat on 
our menus to be the largest share of our total carbon footprint. 
In attempts to lower our food-related emissions and meet 
evolving customer preferences, we have been exploring and 
testing alternative proteins over the past few years. This year we 
expanded our plant-based offering with the introduction of a 
‘Zinger Veggie Tender’ (made from mycoprotein) limited time 
offering as a part of a national window marketing campaign 
in the Netherlands. Our permanent menu in the Netherlands 
already included a Veggie Tender with Original breading, which 
is available as an alternative to chicken in all of our burgers, 
buckets, twister wraps, salads and snack boxes.Climate risk assessment: We conducted an initial climate risk 
and opportunity assessment this year to inform our transition 
plan and risk management in coming years. A climate scenario 
analysis is currently underway, as well as more extensive physical 
risk modelling, to provide us with a better understanding of 
our exposure to potential natural catastrophies and weather 
events that may disrupt our operations. The table shows our 
preliminary list of climate risks and opportunities currently 
identified. In FY26 we will further mature this list by including 
quantifications in alignment with ASRS requirements, with current 
assessments underway.
1. Yum! Brands 2023 Global Citizenship & Sustainability Report.
Type Risk or opportunity
Physical risks Potential damage to our restaurants as a result of extreme and changing weather, such as storms and 
cyclones, flooding, bushfires, inlcuding loss of sales from closed restaurants
Increased costs for adaptation to changing weather, such as installing flood doors and higher (energy) costs 
for HVAC in relation to increased hot weather
Supply chain disruptions (roads blocked, damage to production facilities, farms, harvest and products) 
including higher price of commodities, caused by extreme and changing weather
Transition risks –  
Policy & ReputationPotential reputational, non compliance and litigation risks in case we fail to deliver on our climate 
obligations and ambitions
Transition risks – 
MarketPotential higher building & development costs, due to increasing prices for building materials and labour, 
and/or increased regulatory sustainability requirements for building
Changing consumer sentiments and preferences around fast food and meat may negatively impact our 
sales growth in the future
Transition risks – 
ResourcesGrid congestion in our jurisdictions presents risks around energy (connection) shortage, which limits 
expanding possibilities and related sales growth
Increasing energy costs in the transition to more clean and green energy
Opportunity Changing consumer behaviours may provide opportunities to attract new client groups with healthier and 
plant-based and/or labgrown protein menu offerings
