These	market	tailwinds	are	important,	but	it	is	SGH’s	disciplined	
approach	that	will	continue	to	set	us	apart.	We	are	not	passive	
owners.	We	maintain	a	clear	focus	on	effective	capital	allocation,	
strong	governance	and	active	oversight	to	ensure	the	business	
is	well	positioned	to	identify	and	capture	opportunities	and	
manage	risks	as	they	arise.	The	Board	remains	confident	in	the	
strength	of	SGH’s	strategy,	the	capability	of	our	experienced	
management	team,	and	the	depth	of	talent	across	SGH	to	
deliver	on	our	long-term objectives.	
An important element of this continued strength is our 
deliberate focus	on	Board	capability	and	renewal,	balanced	
with	the	depth	of	experience	needed	to	oversee	a	complex	
portfolio	of	businesses.	To	complement	this	experience	with	
fresh	perspectives,	I	am	pleased	to	note	that	Vik	Bansal,	who	
has played an instrumental role as CEO of Boral in supporting its 
turnaround,	is	expected	to	join	the	SGH	Board	in	the	second	half	
of FY26.	Vik’s	deep	operational	experience,	industry	knowledge	
and	leadership	capability	will	further	strengthen	the	Board’s	
mix	of	skills	and	insights	as	we	continue	to	focus	on	long-term	
value creation.
One	of	the	qualities	that	sets	SGH	apart	is	our	unique	
combination	of	being	founder-led,	while	maintaining	strong	
and	contemporary	corporate	governance.	This	reflects	a	deep	
respect	for	the	benefits	that	robust	governance	brings,	from	
driving	operational	performance	to	supporting	better	access	
to	capital	markets.	It	underpins	our	objective	of	delivering	the	
best outcomes for shareholders through sustainable long-term 
value creation.Equally,	we	recognise	this	objective	is	supported	by	a	clear	
commitment	to	sustainability	and	responsible	stewardship.	
This	year,	we	continued	to	progress	our	decarbonisation	
initiatives	and	climate	transition	planning.	SGH	is	committed	
to	achieving	our	decarbonisation	ambitions,	supported	by	
practical	investments	in	lower-emission	technologies,	efficiency	
improvements	and	process	innovation	across	our	businesses.	
We	acknowledge	that	the	journey	to	net	zero	requires	
collaboration,	clear	frameworks	and	transparent	progress,	and	
the Board remains focused on ensuring that SGH’s sustainability 
commitments support both resilience and long-term shareholder 
value.	I	encourage	you	to	read	more	about	our	sustainability	
progress	and	initiatives	in	the	FY25	Sustainability	Report,	
located	on	pages	29	to	43	of	this	document.
Looking	forward,	SGH	is	well	positioned	to	continue	delivering	
for	shareholders.	From	the	Board’s	perspective,	the	strategy	
is	clear:	drive	operational	performance	through	disciplined	
execution,	deploy	surplus	capital	where	it	delivers	superior	
returns,	and	maintain	a	disciplined	approach	to	growth	and	risk.	
As	we	execute	this	strategy,	we	remain	focused	on	delivering	
stable	and	growing	dividends,	supporting	long-term	total	
shareholder	returns,	and	continuing	to	deliver	financial	and	
operational outperformance.
I	would	like	to	take	this	opportunity	to	thank	my	fellow	Board	
members	for	their	insight,	guidance	and	commitment,	our	
MD&CEO	and	executive	team	for	their	disciplined	leadership,	
and our people across our businesses for their dedication and 
focus	on	execution.	Our	results	are	a	testament	to	their	hard	
work	and professionalism.
Finally,	I	wish	to	thank	you,	our	shareholders,	for	your	continued	
trust	and	support.	We	remain	committed	to	building	on	our	
achievements,	creating	sustainable	long-term	value,	and	
delivering	another	decade	of	strong performance.
Yours	sincerely,
Terry Davis  
Chairman

People
Boral’s	operating	model	is	aligned	with	SGH,	fostering	a	
performance	culture	with	a	strong	accountability	framework.	
At Boral,	this	is	driven	through	a	focus	on	the	STAAR	values	
(Safety,	Teamwork,	Ambition,	Accountability,	and	Respect),	
which	remain	central	to	how	it	operates.
In	FY25,	Boral	expanded	its	learning	programs,	supporting	
stronger	engagement	within	the	business.	Improvement	across	
employee	surveys	and	increased	participation	in	training	
initiatives	in	FY25	reflect	the	success	of	these	initiatives.
Boral’s	enhanced	corporate	culture	and	working	environment	
were	highlighted	by	improved	operational	safety	outcomes,	with	
a	34	per	cent	reduction	in	the	TRIFR	to	2.9.	While	this	represents	
meaningful	progress,	we	were	deeply	saddened	by	the	tragic	
death	of	a	Boral	employee	during	the	year.	This	incident	is	a	
stark	reminder	of	the	importance	of	safety	in	everything	we	do,	
and	Zero	Harm	remains	our	overarching	ambition.
Environment
Boral	continues	to	invest	in	decarbonisation	and	the	circular	
economy	as	part	of	its	long-term	sustainability	strategy.	
In FY25, the	company	increased	the	use	of	alternative	fuels	
at its Berrima	cement	facility	in	New	South	Wales,	reaching	
50 per	cent	usage	of	solid	waste-derived	fuels,	up from	
30	per cent	in	the	prior	year.	This	was	enabled	by	the	
commissioning of a state -of-the-art chlorine bypass system 
and supports	both	emissions	reduction	and	cost efficiency.
The	transition	away	from	coal	as	a	primary	fuel	source	for	kiln	
operations	is	a	material	enabler	of	lower	Scope	1	emissions.	
The alternative	fuels	program	also	diverts	large	volumes	of	
waste that	would	otherwise	end	up	in	landfill,	contributing	
to both	environmental	and	commercial outcomes.
Boral’s	Recycling	business	continues	to	grow,	supported	by	
targeted	investments	in	recovery	infrastructure	and	operational	
processes.	In	FY25,	the	company	increased	recovery	rates	for	
concrete	and	asphalt	waste,	with	internal	capture	and	reuse	
playing	a	larger	role	in	meeting	sustainability	objectives	and	
reducing	input costs.
Markets
Strong demand from infrastructure customers supported 
pricing	traction	and	higher	concrete	volumes,	which	partially	
offset	lower	quarry	volumes	associated	with	softer	residential	
construction	and	roading activity.
Investment	in	major	transport	and	energy	infrastructure	
continued	to	drive	resilient	customer	activity	in	metropolitan	
areas,	with	the	sector	operating	at	or	near	capacity.	Forward	
project	pipelines	remain	solid,	supported	by	Federal	and	State	
funding commitments.
Residential	construction	activity	moderated	during	the	
year,	reflecting	subdued	approvals	and	commencements.	
However, residential	fundamentals	remain	supportive,	and	an	
11 per cent QoQ increase in housing starts to March Q2025 
indicates	progress	towards	a	recovery	in activity.
Boral	continues	to	improve	its	responsiveness	to	changing	
market conditions through enhancements to its go-to -market 
strategy.	In	FY25,	this	included	the	decentralisation	of	
customer	service	and	allocations	functions,	increasing	
the	responsiveness	from	customer	service,	operations	
and	sales	teams.	The business	also	delivered	measurable	
improvements	in	customer	outcomes,	with	grade	of	service	
increasing	by	5 per cent	to	85	per	cent,	and	concrete	DOT	
lifting	13 per cent	to	86 per	cent.	These	improvements	support	
faster	decision -making,	improved	service	reliability,	and	
closer alignment	with	customer	requirements,	positioning	
Boral to	respond	effectively	to	market	dynamics	in FY26.Assets
Boral’s	vertically	integrated	asset	base	is	one	of	its	key	
competitive	advantages.	The	business	continues	to	invest	
in improving	utilisation	and	productivity	across	both	fixed	
and	mobile	assets,	guided	by	the	SCROA	framework	of	Safe,	
Compliant,	Reliable,	and	Optimised Assets.
Boral	invested	$70	million	into	its	heavy	mobile	equipment	
(HME)	fleet	in	FY25.	The	investment	is	expected	to	drive	better	
performance,	lower	maintenance	requirements,	and	increased	
efficiency	across	production	and	quarry operations.
Strategic	asset	acquisitions	were	completed	during	the	
year,	including	Sand	Supplies	and	the	Wallan	concrete	
plant	in	Victoria,	strengthening	the	network	and	extending	
customer reach.
Boral’s property portfolio remains an important source 
of long-term	value.	As	sites	transition	to	non-operational,	
or	surplus,	they	provide	opportunities	for	co-development	
and	leasing	in	the	industrial	property	market.	The	business	
is	actively	evaluating	options	to	unlock	this	value	through	
strategic partnerships.
FY25 Performance
Boral	delivered	significant	earnings	growth	in	FY25,	
reflecting	the continued	execution	of	its	“Good	to	Great”	
strategy.	Revenue grew	by	1	per	cent	to	$3.6	billion,	while	
EBIT	increased by	26	per	cent	to	a	record	$468	million.	
Full year EBIT margin	expanded	to	13.0	per	cent,	progressing	
toward	the	mid-teens	margin	ambition.	This	uplift	in	profitability	
demonstrates	the	potential	of	Boral	and	the	benefits	of	
disciplined	execution,	with	commercial	focus,	cost	control,	
and operational	improvement	driving	stronger	conversion	
of revenue	into earnings.
Price discipline across all product lines contributed to the 
margin	expansion,	supported	by	a	more	responsive	and	
market-led	approach	to	pricing,	customer	engagement,	
and service	delivery.
Operational	performance	also	improved	over	the	year,	with	
gains in	productivity,	plant	reliability,	and	asset	utilisation.	
Enhanced	scheduling,	tighter	cost	control,	and	better	
deployment	of	mobile	assets	enabled	further	margin	expansion.	
These	outcomes	reflect	the	benefits	of	disciplined	execution	
across	the	People,	Environment,	Markets,	Assets,	Financials	
(PEMAF)	framework,	which	continues	to	guide	Boral’s	approach	
to	performance improvement.
Outlook
Boral expects a continuation of operating momentum and 
market	opportunities	into	FY26.	The	business	remains	focused	
on	delivering	its	“Good	to	Great”	strategy,	with	disciplined	
execution	across	pricing,	cost	management,	and	operational	
performance.	Boral’s	more	agile	and	customer -focused	
go-to-market	approach	will	be	key	to	capturing	the	
expected opportunities across both the residential and 
infrastructure pipelines.
There	is	also	further	scope	to	build	on	the	margin	gains	achieved	
in	FY25	through	ongoing	cost	initiatives,	and	investment	across	
the	integrated	network	to	drive	efficiency	and	asset utilisation.
Boral’s	clear	operational	strategy,	privileged	asset	base,	and	
disciplined	investment	approach	position	it	to	deliver	improved	
customer	outcomes	and	drive	further	growth	in FY26.

Sustainability
At SGH, we recognise the meaningful impact and long ‑term 
value our business can contribute to sustainability, the circular 
economy and communities in which we operate.
Our intent is to ensure that environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and sound governance principles 
form an integral part of our strategy and day ‑to‑day operations. We are focused on proactively addressing the 
material issues that matter most to our stakeholders. By continuously evolving our approach and collaborating 
with our people, partners, and communities, we strive to create lasting positive impact and deliver long ‑term 
value for our stakeholders.
Approach and Coverage
Sustainability considerations are embedded in our business 
strategy, risk management, and culture. Our approach is 
focused on our wholly ‑owned and operated businesses and 
designed to deliver long ‑term value for our customers, people, 
shareholders and the communities in which we operate. 
Since 2021, our business has reported on 10 material 
issues identified by our stakeholders where we could have 
the most impact and/or mattered most to our key stakeholders. 
Our material issues align with over twenty of the UN Sustainable 
Development Goal indicators, and cover twelve of the seventeen 
Sustainable Development Goals.
Our business deals with these material issues through 
four key elements of our sustainability framework:
 –People
 –Circular Economy
 –Local Operations
 –Climate Resilience
