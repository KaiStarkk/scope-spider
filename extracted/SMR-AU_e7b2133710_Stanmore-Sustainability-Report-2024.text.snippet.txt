Our Approach  
to Sustainability 4.16
Stanmore  |  Sustainability Report 2024This year our sustainability journey  
further matured, as we adapted to  
changing regulatory demands while 
continuing to deliver tangible value to  
our workforce, shareholders, customers  
and local communities.   
On behalf of the Sustainability Committee, I am pleased  
to share an overview of Stanmore’s progress as we 
continue advancing the commitments outlined in our 
Sustainability Roadmap. 
In 2024, as in previous years, we focused on continuous 
improvement, enhancing sustainability and ESG metrics 
and outcomes, addressing climate and environmental risks, 
and maintaining strong financial performance. As a result, 
we are proud to report that we remain on track with the 
deliverables in the Roadmap. 
Our initiatives this year have been driven by a proactive 
approach to risk management and responsible resource 
use, ensuring that our operations deliver lasting benefits to 
the communities in which we operate, and minimising our 
impact on the environment. 
Against the backdrop of an evolving landscape of 
sustainability practices and disclosures across the industry 
and our ongoing commitment to aligning with best 
practice, our material topics remain unchanged from the 
prior year, though subject to ongoing review to reflect 
emerging issues. This has allowed us to reinforce our  
long-term focus on our themes of People, Community, 
Climate, Environment, and Governance. 
In 2024, regulatory and reporting expectations evolved, 
and we have made significant progress in developing  
climate metrics and processes to align with the Australian 
Sustainability Reporting Standards (ASRS). Additionally,  
we have commenced data collection processes in 
preparation for future Scope 3 reporting, recognising the 
importance of understanding and addressing our full 
value chain emissions. Another key area of focus throughout the year has been  
our preparation for future Taskforce on Nature-related 
Financial Disclosures (TNFD) reporting. We have 
commenced preparation for relevant data collection and 
future reporting, as well as conducting an initial double-
materiality assessment. In simple terms, this means we are 
required to assess both how nature impacts Stanmore's 
financial performance, and how we impact nature. This 
approach is helping evolve our thinking and underscores 
our commitment to a holistic understanding of 
environmental impact. 
Other key highlights of 2024 include: 
• Further development of our Environmental Management 
System (EMS), with the approval of our Environment 
Policy and updates to supporting documents. 
• Progression of our Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) 
commitments and initiation of preparations for our next 
RAP, set for submission in 2025. 
• A review of our five-year Sustainability Roadmap  
to ensure alignment with our long-term vision and 
stakeholder expectations. 
• Advancing the development of our Social Performance 
Framework, including a comprehensive five-year 
roadmap, standards and site procedures.  
• Refinement of our ESG data collection to improve  
the accuracy, consistency and efficiency of our 
sustainability reporting. 
We have made progress on our Decarbonisation Plan,  
with key projects identified and advancements towards 
investment decisions. These initiatives reflect our 
unwavering commitment to reducing our operational 
carbon footprint and transitioning towards a more 
sustainable operational model. 4.1  A Message from the Chair of the 
Sustainability Committee

Looking forward, we remain steadfast in our commitment 
to sustainability. We will continuously enhance our 
strategies, navigate emerging challenges, and explore  
new ways to embed sustainability into our daily operations. 
We will achieve the regulated reduction in operational 
emissions by 2030, meeting our obligations of the 
Safeguard Mechanism. In parallel, we remain committed to 
enhancing the accuracy, consistency, and transparency of 
our ESG data and reporting to ensure stakeholders have 
clear insights into our progress. 
As we look ahead with enthusiasm for the continued 
evolution of our sustainability journey, I would like to 
sincerely thank our dedicated employees, partners, and 
stakeholders for their support and meaningful contributions. 
Your commitment and collaboration have been 
instrumental in driving our progress. Together, we will 
continue to build a resilient and sustainable future  
— one that reflects our shared values and supports  
long-term prosperity for generations to come.

Stanmore  |  Sustainability Report 20244.2  Sustainability Committee
The Sustainability Committee, 
a subcommittee of the Board, provides 
oversight and strategic guidance on 
sustainability matters to ensure alignment 
with Stanmore's long-term goals and 
stakeholder expectations. In 2024, 
the Committee convened four times, 
addressing a wide range of topics. 
Focus areas throughout the year included:
• governance/management systems
• climate change
• decarbonisation
• social performance
• environmental compliance
• waste management/circular economy/recycling
• ESG data collection and reporting.The Committee also discussed emerging trends, especially 
in the legislative area such as the recently mandated 
climate disclosures and reforms to the Environmental 
Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC).
A significant milestone in 2024 was the endorsement of 
Stanmore’s Environment Policy in August, a key component 
of our Environmental Management System (EMS).
The Committee is comprised of three independent,  
non-executive Directors. The Terms of Reference for 
the Committee is available on the Stanmore website.

Risk and description Time horizon
Increasing and Changing Climate Policy and Regulation  
There is a risk that evolving climate and clean energy policies, such as the Safeguard Mechanism and 
regulations capping emissions and imposing carbon costs, could detrimentally affect Stanmore’s operations 
and expose us to regulatory actions that might harm our reputation.Short-term
Lack of Climate Adaptation and Mitigation Activity  
There is a risk that the failure to implement appropriate climate-related strategies to mitigate the effects  
of actual and/or perceived occurrence of climate change events and circumstances may impact Stanmore's 
reputation and stakeholders’ confidence in our operations. Short-term
Lack of Climate Considerations in Strategic Planning and Company Reporting  
There is a risk that Stanmore fails to adequately incorporate climate-related risks and opportunities into 
business strategy and corporate statements. This lack of action could result in regulatory penalties and 
reputational damage, as well as inadequate preparation of our strategy for future challenges within the industry. Short-term
Increasing Climate Activism  
There is a risk of increased activist activity due to the nature of the coal mining industry. Increasing climate 
activism may impact upon the demand for coal within the market which may have negative repercussions 
for financial performance. This can also increase the risk of litigation in relation to failure to comply with 
relevant regulatory requirements.Short-term
Uncertainty in the Procurement of Fuels  
Volatility of the energy market and the impact on pricing and availability of fossil fuels, means there is a 
risk that Stanmore may face uncertainty in the procurement of fossil fuels. An inability to secure fuel for 
operational equipment creates disruptions to operations and can increase costs if alternative fuels and 
equipment need to be procured. Medium-term
Access to Funds and Investment  
There is a risk that Stanmore’s access to adequate capital funds from financial institutions and investors 
may be negatively impacted due to changing sentiment towards coal and divestment of fossil fuels 
impacting Stanmore's ability to secure necessary funds for operations.Medium-term
Access to Insurance  
Stanmore’s access to insurance from financial institutions may be negatively impacted due to changing 
sentiment towards coal and divestment in fossil fuels impacting Stanmore's ability to secure necessary 
funds for operation.Short-term
Staff Attraction and Retention Difficulties 
Challenges in attracting and retaining skilled workers due to the reputation of the coal mining industry and/
or technological changes in the steel-making industry impacting upon the longevity of the industry as a 
whole, create a risk to Stanmore. This risk has potential to impact operational capacity and increase costs 
as a result of high employee turnover. Long-term
Availability of Lower-carbon and Renewable Technological Solutions 
There is a risk that Stanmore may face challenges and or fails to transition to lower emissions technology 
due to uncertainty in the efficacy, availability and cost effectiveness of renewable and low-carbon 
technological solutions. Medium-term
Introduction of New Technologies for Steel Production  
The introduction of new technology and processes for steel production shifts away from traditional primary 
resources such as metallurgical coal impacting demand.Long-term
To address these risks and mitigate the potential impacts, Stanmore is working to integrate a cost of carbon into internal 
frameworks, will be undertaking to quantify and monitor Scope 3 emissions and implement our Decarbonisation Plan. 
Such strategies have been developed having regard to these risks and aim to: 
• Forward plan for the potential costs associated with changing policy and changing regulation and assess the costs and 
benefits of associated potential emissions reduction projects and initiatives; 
• Ensure that these risks are considered within broader strategic and operational planning; 
• Ensure that Stanmore are working on identifying, exploring and implementing technologies and activities to reduce 
emissions (where feasible). 8.  Environment
