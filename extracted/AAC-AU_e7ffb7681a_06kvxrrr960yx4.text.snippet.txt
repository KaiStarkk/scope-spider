AACo completed a lifecycle assessment 
of its GHG emissions footprint, or product carbon footprint (PCF), for both liveweight turnoff and post-processing boxed beef. Adjustments to previous year’s PCF have been made to reflect changes to the feedlot enteric methane measurement methodology and values.
• AACo’s liveweight turnoff PCF was 
11.2kg CO
2-e/kg liveweight turnoff 
after feedlot in FY25. This remained 
steady compared to the previous year’s adjusted liveweight turnoff PCF. Reductions driven by the improved herd performance associated with good seasonal conditions and improved production processes, were offset by an increase in cull beef sales, which have a higher emissions per kilograms of beef output. AACo’s liveweight turnoff PCF remains below the national average.• AACo’s boxed beef PCF was 23.0kg 
CO
2-e/kg beef produced after primary 
processing in FY25. This represents a 2% decrease on the previous year’s adjusted boxed beef turnoff. As with the liveweight results, this was primarily driven by improved herd performance offset by increased cull beef sales. Boxed beef PCF results do not include some classes of cattle that are included in the liveweight results and are not directly comparable.
This year’s results provide further data and insights into AACo’s emissions profile, helping us to build on existing efforts to improve the efficiency of our herd while providing insights into new possibilities for future efforts to reduce our climate impact across our operations.

We continue to prepare for expanded climate -related reporting, with an 
aspiration for our metrics and disclosures to exceed the minimum requirements under the Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards’ mandatory AASB S2: Climate-related Disclosures . 
Our emissions accounting and analysis program informs a more evolved understanding of the interaction between our actions and their impacts on climate. 
Improvements to emissions calculation 
methodologies and the science underpinning them has led to adjustments to the previous year’s emissions profile which are noted below. Further details regarding the adjustments and the GHG emissions profiling methodology used, are detailed in the Sustainability Information section of this report.
In FY25, AACo emitted 662,424 tCO
2-e 
of Scope 1 and 2 emissions, a 3.3% increase 
compared to the adjusted FY24 figures. This was primarily due to an increase in weight gain of livestock and increase in fuel-related emissions. Enteric methane 
represents our largest source of GHG emissions at 88% of Scope 1 and 2 emissions, proportionally remaining steady compared to FY24. A 17% increase in our feedlot population resulted in higher emissions from this part of our operations but also contributed to a proportional increase in the amount of liveweight kilograms produced, reducing our overall emissions footprint.
AACo’s Scope 3 emissions for FY25 were 
159,949 tCO
2-e, representing 19% of our 
overall emissions, with the most significant source being purchased goods and services such as feedlot inputs. Downstream transportation of boxed beef via air and sea freight to our global markets, meat processing, agistment and upstream freight were other significant sources of Scope 3 emissions.

(1) FY23 GHG emissions values calculated using the Primary Industries Climate Challenges Centre (PICCC) and University of Melbourne’s 
Greenhouse Accounting Framework (GAF) for Australian Beef production and feedlots. FY24 and FY25 GHG emissions values calculated using overarching guidelines: GHG Protocol Agricultural Guidance, GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting Reporting Standard, GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard, the National GHG Inventory and the National Greenhouse Accounts Factors. FY24 and FY25 product carbon footprint was determined following the methods outlined in the ISO Standard 14067:2018.
(2) Restated FY24 metric in line with updated science and emissions calculation standards to ensure consistency in comparison between FY24 and FY25.
(3) Restated FY24 metric following the identification of inaccuracies subsequent to release of the FY24 report in natural gas usage. This resulted in a 31% decline for the previously reported fuel consumption and a 30% decline in previously reported total energy consumption by the Company.
(4) Restated FY24 metric following the updated calculator becoming available. In prior year, an estimate of ACCUs generated under the fourth year of the Beef Cattle Management Herd Project was required, due to Clean Energy Regulator calculator remaining unavailable. During FY25, a true-up of 27,602 units was recognised to align with the result through the updated Clean Energy Regulator calculator for the FY24 period.
(5) In FY25, 23 of the 25 livestock carrying properties underwent LPA audits. Two properties did not receive LPA quality assurance certification covering FY25. While annual LPA audits are not mandated by regulation and are generally conducted on a random basis, AACo aims to have all properties audited annually by qualified AUS-MEAT auditors. However, the timing of audits is influenced by auditor availability, particularly given the remote locations of our operations. Audits for the remaining two properties are scheduled for FY26.
(6) A single corrective action request was issued by LPA auditors in relation to one property, concerning a minor administrative oversight involving the transfer of cattle intake data between livestock system databases. The issue has been resolved by the Company and subsequently verified by the auditor. 
(7) A limited quantity of a trial product (1,872kg) outside of AACo’s main beef portfolio, was voluntarily withdrawn following the identification of foreign matter within the packaging of a small number of units. An investigation found that contamination incidences were low (<0.22% of the withdrawn product).
(8) Two of the six third-party processors were not certified under a GFSI-recognised program. For one of these processors, the Company commissioned an independent third-party assessment based on HACCP principles and the FSANZ Food Standards Code (Chapters 3 & 4), which the processor successfully passed. The other processor holds all legally required food safety certifications, including accreditation from Safe Food Queensland. This metric reflects certification status only and does not indicate non-compliance with GFSI standards.
(9) Food safety corrective actions related to the commercial sale of AACo products.
(10) Restated FY24 metric following the identification of inaccuracies subsequent to release of the FY24 report.
(11) KPMG provided limited assurance over the FY25 TRIFR value (85.4) as noted in the Health, Safety & Welfare section of this report that underpins this percentage, and not the percentage itself. Assurance was not undertaken on the FY24 TRIFR value and percentage.
(12) Restated FY23 & FY24 figures to include the Managing Director and CEO.
(13) The pastoral industry is one which relies heavily on a transient workforce. AACo employs a significant number of young people who come to our team for short term employment periods.

GHG Emissions Profiling Methodology
We engaged agricultural and environmental consultancy, Integrity Ag, to support us with calculating AACo’s GHG emissions profile.  
The calculations utilise industry leading intellectual property that is relevant to AACo’s operational context and provides us with additional confidence for more robust disclosure of our Scope 1, 2 and 3 GHG emissions, which have been included within the scope of our limited independent external assurance assessment. The below details form the basis of preparation of AACo’s GHG emissions calculations, with the outcomes detailed in the GHG Emissions Inventory section on of this report, and in the metrics presented in the Sustainability Metrics table.
GHG Accounting Standards
The GHG account is prepared using the following precedent documents:
1.  Au
stralian National Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Inventory – referenced here as the National Inventory Reports (NIRs), for methods to 
determine agricultural emission sources, and some model input data.
2.  Au
stralia’s National Greenhouse Accounts Factors (NGAF) for applicable Scope 1 and 2 emission factors and/or calculation methods.
3.  GHG P
rotocol Agricultural Guidance (WRI & WBCSD 2011) and GHG Protocol Scope 3 (WRI & WBCSD 2022) agricultural and  
Scope 3 carbon account guidance.
These precedent documents are consistent with the recommendations of the ASRS where National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting 
(NGER) methods are not practicable, which is the case for livestock-related emissions. 
The principles followed, as described by the GHG Protocol, are as follows:
• Relevance  – Ensure the GHG inventory appropriately reflects the GHG emissions of the company and serves the decision-making needs 
of users – both internal and external to the company.
• Completeness  – All attributable and accountable emission sources included. Non-attributable and non-reported emissions are described. 
A 1% materiality threshold was accepted (and not more than 5% in aggregate).
• Consistency  – Methods have remained consistent to previous accounts unless scientific changes have occurred in the previous reporting 
period. Calculation method or emission boundary changes have been based on new science and documented. Adjustments have been made 
to previous accounts where appropriate or differences have been quantified if possible. This has been documented.
• Transparency  – Clear disclosure and documentation has been maintained. Non-attributable and non-reported sources have been 
documented and justified.
• Accuracy  – Input data is verifiable. Calculations are verifiable. Uncertainty has been noted where this can be quantified.140Annual Report 2025Australian Agricultural Company LimitedFor personal use only
