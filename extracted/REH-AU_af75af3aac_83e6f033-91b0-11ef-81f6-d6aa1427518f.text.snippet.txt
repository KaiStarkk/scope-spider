Reducing our 
carbon footprint
In 2021, we set out ambitious targets to reduce our carbon 
footprint, knowing that we needed to do further work to 
determine the roadmap to reduction. We knew this would 
be a challenge, particularly for Scope 1 emissions which 
are heavily driven by our company owned vehicle fleet, 
which is critical to the delivery of our customer promise.
We’ve continued learning since that time. Having undertaken 
detailed modelling during FY24 of current and future 
expected commercial electric vehicle fleet options we 
now know that the transition is going to take us longer. 
We are committed to reducing our footprint in a practical 
and commercial way, but the speed to achieve this will be 
dictated by technology and infrastructure. As a result we have 
reset the timeframe for delivering Net Zero in our business 
from 2040 to 2050. We remain committed to delivering 
the 35% reduction in our Scope 2 emissions by 2030.
Key progress in FY24
 -Finalised in depth modelling of solar, 
renewables and fleet to enable a detailed 
pathway to emissions reduction.
 -Rolled out solar PV panels across 
55 Australian sites.
 -Our scope 1 and 2 emissions decreased by 
2.4% from FY23, despite our network growing 
2% and kilometres travelled remaining consistent 
year on year. See page 31 for more detail. 35% 
reduction from FY21  
Scope 2 baseline by 2030.

Trialling heavy duty EV  
at Reece
In FY24 we continued trialling electric vehicles 
in our network, with a medium duty vehicle in 
California. Given the bulky nature and weight 
payload of Reece products and the volume of 
deliveries conducted in a day by a Reece vehicle, 
we found that current commercial EVs do not meet 
Reece’s needs. We would require two EVs to fulfil 
the role of one conventional vehicle after taking 
into account lower range, charge availability and 
charge time. We continue to trial new vehicles as 
they enter the market, but given our vehicle fleet 
is company owned and takes time to transition, 
our timeframes need to adjust to reflect this.

Reece Group1. About this report
The sustainability report covers Reece Limited (‘the Group’ or ‘Reece’) and controlled entities as a Group. This report aims 
to summarise Reece Limited and its subsidiary companies’ performance and approach to sustainability in the year ended 30 
June 2024. The Group has reported the information cited in this report with reference to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) 
standards. Our carbon emissions are aligned with the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol for carbon emission reporting. This 
report should be read alongside our suite of reporting documents, including our 2024 Annual Report, Corporate Governance 
Statement, Modern Slavery Statement and related sustainability reporting available on the Reece Group website.
The Group’s segments are based on the geographical operation of the business and comprise Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) 
and the United States of America (US). Reece Group is a distributor of plumbing, waterworks, bathroom and kitchen, and HVAC-R 
(heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration) products. These products are consistent in both geographic locations. 
2. Future developments in sustainability reporting 
In September 2024, the Australian Government passed a bill to mandate climate-related financial disclosures and the Australian 
Accounting Standards Board (AASB) is developing Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards (ASRS) for entities to meet the 
new requirements. These standards are expected to be aligned with the IFRS Sustainability Reporting Standards and require 
disclosures under four key pillars: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. The Australian standards 
(AASB S1 and S2) will apply to the Group from the financial year ended 30 June 2026.
We have set up a sustainability reporting transformation team encompassing cross-disciplined teams to work towards FY26 
mandatory sustainability reporting. During FY24, we have performed a gap analysis against the incoming sustainability reporting 
standards and have made headway closing gaps in preparation for FY26. We also undertook a detailed analysis of our 
sustainability risks and opportunities across the Group. We completed a range of engagements across our business to identify 
risks and opportunities and, with the help of an external consultant, conducted further analysis and modelling on the impact of 
these to our business under various temperature and timeframe scenarios. We are currently reviewing our key climate-related risks 
and opportunities to assist us to understand and take action to strengthen our climate resilience. 
Scope 3 GHG emissions
In FY23 we began a process to quantify our Scope 3 emissions by determining our measurement approach in alignment with the 
GHG protocol. In FY24 we assessed the Scope 3 emissions for our Australia region, and we will now expand this assessment to 
cover NZ and the US. These disclosures will be aligned to the AASB requirements and disclosed in FY27.  Sustainability disclosures

4.8 Reducing our carbon footprint
In FY24, the Group’s Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions were 63,996 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e-), 
calculated on market-based methodology to reflect our use of renewable energy. This represents a 2.4% decrease on FY23,  
and a 0.2% decrease on our FY21 baseline. 
Across the Group, we grew our network by 2% in FY24. Fuel use was flat compared to the prior year, as kilometres travelled 
by our fleet remained consistent with FY23. Our electricity consumption was also flat year on year, while we realised a 
benefit upon conversion to tCO2e- due to the broader decarbonisation of the grid. 
The tables below outline Reece’s decarbonisation performance data since our baseline year.

For information regarding our ethical supply chain performance during FY24, refer to the 
Group’s Modern Slavery Statement which will be released in December 2024. Solar energy  
In FY22 we kicked off a significant project to understand how we could roll-out solar across our sites in 
Australia. In FY24 we are well and truly on our way, having now rolled out 131 solar photovoltaics (PV) across 
our Australian network and are looking at the potential opportunity for our US region. In New Zealand we have 
an existing renewable energy partnership, however will continue to consider solar into the future.
