Carbon Positive:  We 
fund community forests 
nationwide by:
  Planting trees in urban 
centres to reduce urban 
heat impacts.
  Restoring cleared and 
degraded agricultural 
land.
  Partnering with regional and remote 
communities to support local ecosystems.
Food Ladder:  Through hydroponic greenhouse 
programs, Food Ladder reduces reliance on 
long-distance food supply chains in remote 
communities, lowering transport emissions 
and building local climate resilience. These 
projects also promote sustainable agriculture 
practices that support long-term ecosystem 
health.
