•,"The Commercial Real Estate (Offices) target includes scope 1 and 2, for base building operational emissions. Where customer reported emission data is used, we have given preference to"
,"market-based emissions data (i.e., including the use of power purchase agreements or Greenpower) over location-based emissions data."
•,The Residential Real Estate (Australia) target includes scope 1 (excluding fugitive and LPG emissions) and 2 emissions only;
•,"The Agriculture (Australia Beef and Sheep, and Australia Dairy) targets include scope 1 land management emissions which include biogenic methane from ruminant livestock, emissions from"
