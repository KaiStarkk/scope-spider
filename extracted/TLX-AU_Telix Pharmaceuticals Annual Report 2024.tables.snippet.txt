This understanding particularly supports our mission to develop and commercialize theranostics for patients living with,
cancer and rare diseases.,
"Throughout 2024, we strengthened our environmental risk assessment capabilities through comprehensive cross-",
functional evaluations. Our teams conducted detailed assessments of how extreme weather and climate-related events,
"could affect various aspects of our operations. This analysis spanned multiple business units, including manufacturing,",
"logistics and supply chain, people and culture, finance, asset and program development, research and innovation, and",
"workplace health and safety. Looking forward, we are developing more sophisticated strategies to quantify the financial",
"implications of extreme weather events, such as supply chain interruptions. This enhanced understanding will enable",
"us to mature our mitigation and intervention plans. These financial impacts will undergo continuous assessment, with",
material findings incorporated into our disclosure reporting. A key priority for 2025 is the implementation of a robust,
methodology to fully integrate climate-related considerations into our business planning processes.,
Our approach to climate risk assessment operates across three distinct time horizons. Short-term considerations (0-2,
years) align with our annual budgeting and operational planning cycles. Medium-term analysis (2-5 years) focuses on,
achieving interim sustainability goals and targets. Long-term planning (5+ years) encompasses the complete lifecycle of,
"our assets, from initial concept through to full commercialization.",
"Through our ongoing assessment process, we have identified that climate-related risks and opportunities primarily",
concentrate on two critical areas: asset development and supply chain resilience. The global impact of both acute,
"and chronic physical risks, combined with transition risks related to regulatory and commercial changes, is expected",
to have the most significant influence on our ability to achieve strategic objectives over the long term. This,
understanding drives our commitment to developing comprehensive strategies that address both environmental impact,
and business sustainability.,
Scenario analysis and future planning,
"To strengthen our climate resilience strategy, we have developed detailed qualitative scenario analyses based on two",
"potential future states: a 1.5°C increase in global average temperature above pre-industrial levels by 2040, and a more",
severe scenario of 2.5°C or higher by 2065. These analyses inform our understanding of potential impacts across our,
global operations and supply chain.,
"As we look toward 2025, our strategic priorities encompass several key initiatives. We are developing sophisticated",
methodologies to quantify the financial impact of extreme weather events on our operations. This includes implementing,
"energy efficiency initiatives and renewable energy projects where practicable, while incorporating both qualitative and",
"quantitative physical climate scenarios into our supply chain, built asset, and operational decisions.",
Metrics and progress,
The year 2024 marked substantial progress in our capabilities to capture and report absolute gross greenhouse gas,
"emissions. Following the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, we have successfully implemented systems and processes to track",
"both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, using market-based and location-based methods. Our internal systems have met",
"all targeted benchmarks, positioning us to leverage this comprehensive data in 2025 to establish our baseline carbon",
footprint and develop science-based measurable targets.,
"This progress enables us to implement an internal carbon pricing mechanism, providing a framework to assess",
"the financial implications of changes in investment, production, and consumption patterns. We continue to evaluate",
potential technological advancements and future emissions-abatement costs as part of our commitment to long-term,
environmental sustainability and business resilience.,
