Chair and MD & CEO’s Message
Dear Shareholders
It has been three years since AGL reset its strategy. In September 
2022, in line with AGL’s inaugural Climate Transition Action Plan 
(CTAP), AGL set out a multi-decade strategy to progressively 
decarbonise its asset portfolio with new renewable and firming 
capacity. This included an ambition to supply our customer 
demand with 12 GW of new generation and firming  capacity by 
the end of 2035 and an interim target to have 5 GW of new 
renewables and firming  in place by 2030, including to seek options 
to accelerate where possible.
Over the past three years we have 
deployed or committed over $3 billion 
towards our decarbonisation strategy, 
and AGL’s  development pipeline has tripled 
from 3.2 GW to 9.6 GW. We also have 
access to a further 9 GW of early-
stage opportunities.
As at 30 June  2025, AGL’s operated scope 1 & 2 emissions were 
30.7 MtCO2e, which is a 29.1% reduction against an FY19 baseline.
We have also delivered a number of initiatives to drive 
electrification  and support our customers decarbonise the way 
they live, move and work.
We are focused on delivering long-term value through disciplined, 
year-on-year delivery and execution.
During FY25, we continued our strong progress while also 
delivering solid financial  and operational results. We have also 
evolved our strategy and set new targets to allow us to continue to 
generate long-term sustainable value through the energy transition.Highlighted below is a summary of what we achieved during FY25, 
our new targets, and an outlook for the year ahead.
FY25 financial and operational results
Our FY25 results were in line with our FY25 earnings guidance. 
We achieved:
•Underlying Net Profit  after tax of $640 million, which excludes 
movements in the fair value of financial  instruments and 
significant  items. We incurred a statutory loss of $(98) million, 
including significant  items of $(596) million (post-tax). The 
statutory loss primarily related to lower forecasted electricity 
and renewable energy certificate  pricing, which resulted in a 
$(398) million increase in onerous contract provisions for various 
legacy power purchase agreements and a negative movement 
in the fair value of financial  instruments of $(142) million. Retail 
Transformation costs of $(87) million were also recognised as a 
significant  item.
•Underlying EBITDA of $2,010 million.
The Board has declared a final FY25 dividend of [25] cents per 
share (fully franked), resulting in a total dividend for FY25 of 
[48] cents  per share (fully franked).
The strong financial  performance was achieved during FY25 despite 
reduced fleet  availability in the second half of FY25. The FY25 result 
demonstrates the flexibility  and breadth of AGL’s portfolio, including 
the strong earnings from our growing battery portfolio.
AGL’s flexible  asset fleet  capacity has grown to 8.3 GW, which is 
spread across a diverse range of asset types and continues to 
deliver increasing portfolio benefits  to AGL. This also means that 
in periods of planned and forced outages across AGL’s coal-fired  
fleet,  AGL has significant  flexibility  across its hydro operations, 
gas peakers and batteries, in addition to demand response 
mechanisms under our contracts with aluminium smelters, to 
manage market demand and generate value.

Improved safety performance and 
employee engagement
In FY25, we were pleased that AGL’s safety performance improved 
significantly  from FY24 as a result of a targeted program of 
initiatives to reinforce a culture of shared responsibility and 
continuous improvement across our operations. These initiatives 
included training, strengthened governance and enhanced 
risk visibility.
AGL’s FY25 employee engagement score increased by 1 percentage 
point to 73%, representing the continued focus on developing our 
people to ensure we have the skills and capabilities for the future.
Investments and growth to deliver AGL’s strategy
During FY25, we made a number of important investments to 
progress our strategy to connect our customers to a sustainable 
future and to transition our energy portfolio
This included:
•the acquisition of Firm Power and Terrain Solar in September 
2024. The acquisition provided access to 21 battery projects in 
development and six solar projects in development to provide 
further optionality for AGL’s development pipeline.
•the acquisition of Everty, an EV software platform that provides 
charging and energy management solutions for electric vehicles. 
This has allowed AGL to continue to offer  innovative solutions 
and encourage widespread adoption of electric vehicles.
•the acquisition of two pumped hydro energy storage projects 
located in the Hunter region of NSW. These projects are an 
important addition to AGL’s long duration storage opportunities.
•completion of the acquisition of the 20% equity interest in 
Kaluza, underpinning AGL’s Retail Transformation Program.
This momentum has continued into FY26 with:
•the acquisition of South Australia’s Virtual Power Plant (VPP) 
from Tesla. This is one of Australia’s largest VPPs, comprised 
of distributed solar capacity and about 7,000 Powerwall home 
batteries.  More batteries are expected to be installed this year 
as we look to develop Australia’s largest social and community 
housing VPP .
•final investment decision reached on the 500 MW/ 2,000 MWh 
Tomago Battery Project. The Tomago Battery Project adds to 
AGL’s existing grid-scale battery portfolio, with the 500 MW/ 
1,000 MWh Liddell Battery on track for commencement of 
operations in early 2026.
•the acquisition of the Yadnarie solar and long duration energy 
storage project. This project is based on RayGen’s PV Ultra 
and Thermal Hydro technology, demonstrating our investment 
in innovative solar-and-storage system technology as a potential 
solution to the need for long duration energy storage.
Supporting Our Customers
AGL is Australia’s leading energy brand, with over 4.56 million 
customer services. During FY25, we focused on helping our 
customers decarbonise the way they live, move and work, while 
also supporting many customers facing cost-of-living pressures.
We have now completed our two-year $90 million customer 
support package. This included $76 million in direct financial 
support such as debt relief and payment matching, and the 
installation of solar and/or batteries for customers experiencing 
vulnerability. Key learnings from this program have been embedded into our everyday operations and we continue to implement 
programs to help our customers.
As an example, we recently launched AGL Community Power, 
which seeks to find ways to share the benefits  of the energy 
transition with those who cannot purchase solar and batteries 
or who may be locked out due to barriers to home ownership. 
As part of this program, we are partnering on the emPowering 
SA program to construct, install and/or operate 18 community 
batteries (~11.5 MW)  and share benefits  through discounted 
electricity for up to 11,000 customers.
We continue to offer  innovative products and services to drive 
electrification  of homes and businesses, including:
•Rooftop solar to approximately 650,000 solar customers.
•Our demand-response Peak Energy Rewards program.
•Electric vehicle charging and orchestration - we currently have 
approximately 32,000 customers on electric vehicle plans.
•Our VPP , which will play an important role in providing flexibility 
and helping to balance grid stability.
We’ve expanded our free digital advisory tool “Electrify Now”. 
This tool leverages energy usage data to deliver a personalised 
electrification  savings report for customers, with estimated energy 
bill and carbon savings for products like solar, batteries and electric 
appliances. We have had over 500,000 visits to Electrify Now since 
May 2024.
We have also partnered with fintech  lender Plenti Group 
Limited to offer  eligible customers discounted finance  rates for 
residential solar batteries, with support from the Clean Energy 
Finance Corporation.
Our retail transformation program is also underway to deliver 
more seamless, customer focused experiences. Phase 1 of the 
program (Salesforce) has been successfully implemented to deliver 
enhanced customer and agent experience.
Embracing ESG and 2025 CTAP
During FY25 the Board approved an ESG decision making 
framework to embed ESG considerations into the work we 
do and the decisions we make to safeguard our business, 
access future opportunities, unlock strategic value and create 
competitive advantage.
Pages 12-13 of the Annual Report provide a summary of how 
we have considered our responsibilities to our people, customers, 
investors, the environment and the communities in which we 
operate during FY25.
A key focus of the Board during FY25 was oversight of AGL’s 2025 
CTAP . The 2025 CTAP was released as part of AGL’s FY25 Results 
and will be subject to a shareholder vote at the 2025 AGM.
Importantly, we have built on our ambitions since our 2022 CTAP , 
including increasing our interim target from 5 GW by 2030 to 
6 GW by FY30, of which we’re targeting at least 3 GW of grid-
scale batteries.
We have bolstered our interim Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction 
targets, prioritising direct emissions reductions, and set a new 
ambition to reduce our Scope 3 emissions by 60% compared to 
FY19 levels following the closure of our coal-fired  power stations.
