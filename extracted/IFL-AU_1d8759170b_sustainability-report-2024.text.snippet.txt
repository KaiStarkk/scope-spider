The Group achieved Climate Active 
certification for the third consecutive year after calculating and offsetting our Group operating emissions, including Scope 1, 2 and operational scope 3 for FY23 through carbon credits purchase. We acknowledge that organisations should reduce actual emissions, rather than rely on offset strategies. Leveraging our 2023 emissions report, we have developed an operational emissions reduction plan for publication in FY25 to address our reduction of operational emissions.
We are enhancing our responsible 
investment approach across the Group, including educating entity directors on related topics. Our affiliations with the Investor Group on Climate Change (IGCC) and the Responsible Investment Association of Australasia (RIAA) through MLC Asset Management inform our ESG-related risk strategies in our investment operations.
The Group welcomes the 
Australian Government’s Treasury Laws Amendment (Financial Market Infrastructure and Other Measures) Bill 2024 and supports the adoption of the proposed Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards (ASRS), to be released in FY25. The Group has established a cross-functional working group to assess our capability and develop an implementation plan to meet these ASRS. The Group’s first year of reporting under the ASRS will be for the year ending 30 June 2026.Our commitment 
to environmental 
sustainability 
We endorse global endeavours  
to achieve net zero greenhouse  
gas emissions by 2050.

ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY 
Environmental  
impact
We are conscious of the environmental impact of our operations as  
a business. We seek to better understand and assess the implications 
o
f climate change and its potential risks on our supply chains, 
investment portfolios and the communities we serve.
We must understand and assess the implications of 
climate change and its potential risks on our supply chains, investment portfolios and the communities we serve.
The Group supports the government’s commitment to 
meet the net zero carbon emissions goal by 2050. After calculating the Group’s Scope 1, 2, and 3 operational emissions for FY23 and offsetting them via carbon credits, the Group achieved Climate Active certification for the third consecutive year.
Leveraging our FY23 emissions report, we initiated our 
Emissions Reduction Plan (for publication in FY25) and set reduction targets. We have shortlisted carbon accounting software providers to measure our emissions in real time, to prepare for reporting carbon emissions in alignment with the draft Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards (ASRS).
To date, our environmental impact initiatives have primarily 
been at the corporate entity level. In acknowledgement 
of the impact of our investments, we are expanding our focus at the superannuation and investment fund levels through education to enable strategic thinking on the environmental impact of our investment portfolios and superannuation products.Environmental impact
Independent consultants estimated the Group’s operational greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) for FY23 at 14,660 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-e), including indirect contributions along the supply chain (Scope 3 emissions). This demonstrates a 2.9% decrease in emissions compared to our FY22 baseline of 15,106.9 tonnes CO2-e, largely due to a decrease in the number of full-time equivalent employees within the business.
Nature-related sustainability disclosure
We will develop a Group Biodiversity assessment and action plan to identify nature risk by the end of FY26 and to prepare for the International Sustainability Standards Boards (ISSB’s) potential next topic for disclosure intended to address nature risks.
Our current emissions reporting is on a one-year lag due to the manual nature of the calculations and data gathering. We have engaged a digital systems provider to assist us with building point-in-time reporting, which we aim to have implemented in FY25.

Investment committees
The Group’s fiduciary boards have investment committees that 
have approved and implemented responsible investing policies that recognise the direct and indirect financial implications of climate change. Climate and other investment risks is managed from an asset allocation and investment manager allocation perspective by these committees.
Investment teams
The Group’s investment teams implement the responsible investing 
policies and report on progress. The Chief Investment Officer (CIO) is responsible for the management of portfolio risks, including those related to climate, as part of their overall responsibility for the investment program. The Head of Responsible Investment leads the application and development of responsible investment in the investment process and reports to the CIO.
Climate strategy
The Group recognises the critical role that corporations must play in leading the transition to a low-carbon economy.
Regarding our investment portfolios, we are developing our 
internal capability to measure and analyse physical and transitional climate risks in order to understand potential impacts on returns and fulfil the requirements of the forthcoming climate reporting legislation under the Treasury Amendments Act.
At an enterprise level, we have calculated our Scope 1, 2 and 
3 operational emissions since FY21 and this year we reported on FY23 operational emissions. This data shed light on our key emission areas and year-to-year trends and enabled us to initiate an emissions reduction action plan for publication in FY25.
We purchased carbon offsets for our Scope 1, 2 and 3 operational emissions, a strategy endorsed by Climate Active for the third year. Our economy requires actual emissions to be reduced to reach decarbonisation targets, and we will work with our entity boards to agree on reduction targets, supported by an action plan.
1. Transition Risks
These are risks and  
opportunities created as  
the world transitions to a  
low-carbon economy.
These are physical risks to 
businessess and assets due 
to changing weather patterns, 
such as severe weather events, 
longer-term shifts in climate 
and rising sea levels.

In FY25, our focus will be on building our capability 
to deliver on the upcoming ASRS-aligned climate risk reporting standards across all the Group entities. We will implement our emissions reduction action plan to track progress via our in-house digital emissions accounting system.
To assess and manage climate impacts, we: 
• measured the Group’s Scope 1, 2 and 3 operational emissions for the third year – see environmental impacts section (page 10) 
• achieved Climate Active certification for the third year, recognising our carbon-neutral status for operational emissions
• delivered our third climate risk report, aligning to the TCFD framework
• extended the CCSF to assess climate risk at an asset allocation level for all in-house multimanager funds, in addition to MySuper investment portfolios
• developed an emissions reduction plan based on data from FY22 and FY23, to be endorsed by the IFL Board
• delivered our climate risk reporting roadmap and initiated our implementation plan to build capability across the business to meet the proposed ASRS.In FY25, the Group will:
• complete the implementation of our in-house digital carbon accounting system to track progress against the emissions reduction action plan
• continue implementation of roadmap to meet new ASRS climate related reporting
• continue to educate and engage with entity boards to better understand and address climate risks across the business
• develop a climate risk reporting governance roadmap for all Group entity boards
• undertake a climate reporting pre-assurance assessment with an external auditor to develop a climate reporting assurance plan and strengthen governance frameworks
• work with enterprise Risk Management team to develop an ESG and climate risk accountability framework across the business
• formalise our Active Stewardship strategy focused on material investment portfolio climate risk.
