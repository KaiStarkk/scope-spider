CSL’s Sustainability Strategy
Advancing CSL’s 
Sustainability Strategy
In FY2025, CSL continued to deliver on 
its sustainability strategy, first launched 
in 2021, with a focus on two key pillars: 
Healthier Environment and Healthier 
Communities. Guided by CSL’s purpose 
and informed by the latest materiality 
assessment, CSL has made steady 
progress toward its long-term goals.
KEY HIGHLIGHTS:
HEALTHIER COMMUNITIES
• CSL continues its longstanding 
partnership with the World 
Federation of Haemophilia (WFH), 
donating product specifically 
manufactured to treat patients with 
bleeding disorders globally. 
• In support of reaching more 
communities and patients through 
discounted products, CSL set a new 
aspirational commitment to treat up 
to 450,000 people with anaemia in at 
least three low- and middle-income 
countries with CSL Vifor’s Ferinject® 
by FY2030. 
• Continued investment in donor safety 
and wellbeing through CSL’s Donor 
experience initiatives, as outlined on 
pages 31–33.
HEALTHIER ENVIRONMENT
• Advanced toward CSL’s FY2030 
target of a 42% absolute reduction 
in Scope 1 and 2 emissions from a 
FY2021 base year, supported by the 
launch of a Renewable-linked Power 
Purchasing Agreement covering all 
Australian sites.
• 37% of global electricity now sourced 
from renewables, contributing to 
approximately 14% reduction in  
Scope 1 and 2 emissions from a 
FY2021 baseline.
• Introduced Biodiversity as a 
new focus area, with site impact 
assessments underway and a 
target set for sourcing all paper and 
fibreboard used in product packaging 
from certified sustainable forestry. 
• Continued supplier engagement, 
with 54.2% of suppliers that 
contribute to CSL’s Scope 3 emissions 
now disclosing or aligning with 
Science-Based Targets initiatives 
(SBTi) targets.Despite a dynamic regulatory 
landscape, CSL remains committed 
to its sustainability ambitions. Some 
adjustments to the activities undertaken 
reflect the resilience of CSL’s strategy and 
its alignment with long-term business 
success and shared value creation.
In addition to CSL’s strategic focus areas, 
a detailed sustainability materiality 
assessment is conducted every two 
years, to enable topics that matter most 
to CSL’s key stakeholders to be identified 
and reported. CSL’s most recent 
sustainability materiality assessment 
was undertaken in FY2024 following 
the GRI 3: Material Topics 2021 (GRI 3) 
standard. The prioritised results of this 
assessment and methodology, which 
received limited assurance in FY2024 
by Deloitte, can be found on CSL.com.

CSL views environmental stewardship 
as its responsibility and an 
opportunity to build healthier and 
more sustainable communities. 
CSL is committed to conducting all 
its operations in a way that minimises 
negative impact on the environment, 
and aims to protect biodiversity and 
conserve natural resources. 
CSL has an established Environment, 
Health, Safety (EHS) function and an 
EHS management system that enable 
CSL facilities to operate to industry 
and regulatory standards. In line with 
CSL’s commitment to promoting 
environmental protection, there were 
no significant environmental breaches1 
at CSL sites during the reporting period.
In FY2025, CSL continued to execute 
on its Healthier Environment initiatives 
with the inclusion of Biodiversity as a 
focus area. 
1. A significant environmental breach is defined as a non-compliance with environmental legislation in the jurisdiction in which the event occurs, 
that has an impact rating of major or critical for environmental or regulatory dimensions as per CSL’s Enterprise Risk Management Framework
2. In 2022, CSL announced its initial target to reduce emissions associated with its own operations by 40%. This target has since been updated to 
42% to align with the SBTi’s reporting period for calendar years. CSL’s Scope 3-related target, approved by the SBTi (as outlined above), is part of 
CSL’s broader intention to engage suppliers who account for 67% of all CSL’s total Scope 3 emissions. CSL aims for these suppliers to have Scope 1 
and 2 emissions reduction targets aligned* with the SBTi. This broader intention applies to suppliers across all Scope 3 categories.
 The target boundary includes land-related emissions and removals from bioenergy feedstocks.
 *  Either the supplier has SBTi-validated targets, or CSL has conducted due diligence to confirm that the supplier’s targets meet SBTi criteria.

Cataratas do Iguaçu  
The Cataratas do Iguaçu (or 
Iguazu Falls) are the world’s 
largest waterfall system, 
dividing the upper and lower 
Iguazu River at the border of 
Argentina and Brazil. Both 
countries created national 
parks in the 1930s to protect 
and preserve the falls for future 
generations, and the falls were 
designated a UNESCO World 
Heritage Site in the 1980s.

the SBTi
At the end of May 2025, the Science 
Based Targets initiative (SBTi) 
approved CSL’s near-term science-
based emissions reduction targets.
The Science Based Targets initiative 
(SBTi) has approved CSL’s near-term 
science based emissions reduction 
targets. These are:
• CSL commits to reduce absolute 
Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas 
emissions by 42%  by FY 2030 
(from a FY 2021 base year)2.
• CSL commits that 73.1%  of 
CSL’s suppliers by emissions – 
covering Scope 3 categories: 
purchased goods and services, 
capital goods, upstream 
transportation and distribution, 
business travel, and downstream 
transportation and distribution – 
will have science-based targets 
by FY 2030.CSL’s strategic sustainability focus 
areas include:
Energy  – undertake initiatives that 
reduce emissions internally and across 
CSL’s supply chain
Waste  – divert waste from landfill 
through reducing, reusing, recycling 
and composting
Water  – identify, prioritise and 
implement water reduction initiatives
Biodiversity  – mitigate the impact on 
nature from CSL direct operations & 
increase the resiliency of the supply 
chain via sustainable sourcing.Healthier Environment

Progress on CSL’s 
emissions targets
In achieving CSL’s emission reduction 
targets, the Company does not 
anticipate seeing a linear reduction 
in the early years, especially in Scope 
1 emissions, which are more difficult 
to reduce. Compared to FY2024, 
there was no significant movement 
in Scope 1 emissions in FY2025. CSL 
continues to execute its roadmap of 
deploying energy efficiency measures 
and reduction projects needed to 
meet its FY2030 commitment, while 
maintaining optimal operational 
capability to meet the levels of 
production needed to manufacture 
its products. In FY2025 the results and 
outcomes of the extensive projects 
and initiatives across the CSL network 
had begun to be realised, CSL’s 
Scope 2 emissions have decreased by 
approximately 29%, since FY2024. This 
was largely driven by CSL’s Australian 
sites’ move to renewable electricity 
from 1 January 2025 as part of its 
Renewable-Linked Power Purchase 
Agreement (PPA) with AGL.
CSL has continued engaging with 
its suppliers that contribute to CSL’s 
Scope 3 emissions. To date, CSL has 
actively engaged with 71.3% of suppliers 
by emissions to set SBTi aligned targets 
and currently 54.2% of CSL’s suppliers 
by emissions^ have self -reported to 
have Scope 1 and 2 SBTi aligned targets.
^ Based on the supplier’s proportion of 
CSL’s total FY2023 Scope 3 emissions.Healthier Environment

1. Data reported is inclusive of: CSL Behring’s manufacturing facilities in Australia, Germany, 
Switzerland, the United States (US) including CSL’s saline manufacturing facility and 
(until its divestment on 16 October 2024) China. CSL Seqirus’ three manufacturing facilities in 
Australia, the United Kingdom and US. 
2. CSL Plasma operations, including plasma centres across China, Germany, Hungary and 
the US, two major plasma logistics centres and CSL Plasma’s United States laboratory. 
Administrative and R&D operations co-located with CSL’s manufacturing facilities and the 
respective head offices for CSL Behring (King of Prussia, US), CSL Plasma (Boca Raton, 
US) and CSL Limited (Melbourne, Australia). Note that CSL divested manufacturing and 
plasma centres in China in October 2024. This includes CSL Vifor’s manufacturing facility in 
Switzerland following acquisition in August 2022.
3. Energy use figures are based on invoices for supplied energy. Emissions are calculated based 
on this information and recognised emission factors. Where invoice data is not available for 
a month, the energy use has been estimated based on previous results. CSL Plasma uses 
validated factors to calculate electrical power and gas consumption. Utility invoices were 
used to establish these factors and calculate natural gas and electricity consumption for 
all CSL Plasma centres. Utility invoices were also used for CSL Plasma Logistic centres and 
laboratories (United States). 
4. Total emissions are expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-e). Scope 2 emissions are 
reported on a market basis. 
5. This includes Scope 1 and 2 energy sources. Scope 1 energy sources are fossil energy sources 
used onsite such as natural gas, diesel, petrol and heating oil. Scope 2 energy sources are 
electricity, steam supplied to site, district heating (hot water) and chilled water. 
* Limited assurance provided by Deloitte.
** CSL has moved to 30 June year end reporting for its environmental data commencing in 
FY2025. CSL’s 2024 comparative has also been changed to reflect a period ending 30 June, 
as such due to seasonality the FY2024 numbers will be different to those reported for 
2023–2024 (April–March) period in last year’s Annual Report. Limited assurance was provided 
by Deloitte on those numbers reported in the FY2024 Annual Report for the reporting 
period of April 2023 to March 2024.
