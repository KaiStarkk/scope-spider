Woolworths Group is continuing its long-standing commitment to contribute to a 1.5°C pathway and aims to reach net-zero,"We’re on track to achieve 100% renewable electricity for our operations by the end of 2025, in line with the RE100"
emissions across the value chain by 2050. The net-zero ambition is supported by near- and long-term emissions reduction,framework and building on our progress in reaching over 30% renewable electricity in F25. Our strategy combines
