To mitigate the risks above, some measures are taken as detailed below:
Metrics and Targets
Nickel Industries acknowledges its responsibility to support the 
global transition to a low-carbon economy while mitigating climate 
risks across its operations. The Company is committed to a 50% 
reduction in carbon intensity by 2035 and achieving net-zero 
emissions by 2050, using 2022 as a baseline. While early-stage 
initiatives have been implemented, the full impact on absolute and intensity metrics reduction is expected to materialise from 2025 
onward. The expected commissioning of the ENC HPAL project in 
the second half of 2025 is expected to deliver material reductions 
in carbon emissions intensity, which remains a focus area for 
execution and monitoring.a. Physical Risk Management Measures:
• Monitoring acute and chronic climate 
risks through annual data collection.
• Developing and implementing water 
management plans.
• Enhancing water recycling to reduce 
losses from waste, leakage, and 
evaporation.
• Establishing contingency plans for 
extreme climate events.b. Transition Risk Management Measures:
• Continuing the 'Future Energy' collaboration to accelerate renewable energy 
adoption.
• Proactively integrating green practices in anticipation of carbon taxation.
• Developing and utilising low-carbon technologies for processing nickel ores.
• Strengthening its reputation as a responsible nickel producer to foster investor 
and public trust.
• Expanding its market presence in high-grade nickel to position itself as a leader 
in sustainable mining and EV battery supply chains.
• Monitoring Indonesian and global climate policies to remain adaptive and 
explore strategic collaborations.
Emissions [305-1, 305-2, 305-3, 305-4, 14.1.5, 14.1.6, 14.1.7, 14.1.8, 14.1.9] [EM-MM-110a.1, EM-MM-120a.1]
Nickel Industries calculates its GHG emissions in accordance with 
ISO 14064-1:2018 and the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Standard, 
covering operations at Hengjaya Mine and its RKEF facilities: 
Hengjaya Nickel, Ranger Nickel, Angel Nickel, and Oracle Nickel.
In 2024, Oracle Nickel transitioned from using recycled furnace 
gas to coke oven gas sourced from IMIP coking plants to enhance 
resource efficiency. Distributed via a 3-kilometre pipeline, this 
cleaner fuel replaces approximately 800 tonnes of coal per day, 
reducing coal consumption per 1% nickel produced from 0.108 
tonnes to 0.051 tonnes monthly. In line with its energy transition strategy, Nickel Industries 
introduced eight electric loaders at Hengjaya Nickel and Ranger 
Nickel in early 2024, replacing diesel-powered units. Electric 
loaders, consuming 73% less energy, significantly reduce fuel 
costs and emissions. Compared to diesel loaders, which require 
12.6 litres of biodiesel per hour, electric loaders operate at 34.62 
kWh per hour, cutting operational energy demand and lowering the 
environmental footprint.
