Develop a Climate Action and Resilience Plan 
Our Climate Action and Resilience Plan was developed and 
approved in June.
Maintain carbon neutral certification We are proud to have received carbon neutral certification 
for our operational FY23 emissions from Climate Active. 
Maintain Scope 1 and 2 emissions and 2.5% reduction in Scope 3 emissionsIn FY24 our total emissions rose 23.8%. Scope 1 emissions 
rose by 7.2% and our Scope 2 emissions fell by 9.9%. Our Scope 3 emissions increased by 24.4% driven by an uplift in marketing and advertising expenses to support business growth, as well as increased business travel. Accordingly, we have not achieved this target. 
For more information on our emissions see page 17.

was 57% female-identifying, 43% male-identifying and 0% gender diverse.
In Board positions, we are slightly below target at 37.5% 
female representation
2. In Non-Executive Director positions, 
we achieved 40/40/20 representation.
As a result, we consider our target to be partially met.See page 19 for further information.

Provide three career pathway programs for people early in their career to join nibDuring the year we provided three career pathway programs 
to people early in their career to join nib. These were our Tupu Toa Internship Program in New Zealand, our 2024 Graduate Program, and a program that saw us welcome four First Nations trainees into the arhi Contact Centre.
Employee engagement score of 79% or greater
Our FY24 employee engagement score was 77%. This is 
above the global benchmark of 73% but is below our target of 79%.

Taking action on emissions 
In FY24, we took the next step in our 
climate strategy, developing our internal Climate Action and Resilience Plan (Plan). The Plan features a roadmap to reducing our environmental impact and making our business more resilient. It sets out the actions we will take to lower our emissions and sits within our wider strategic approach of limiting our footprint on our path to net zero. 
The Plan was developed in consultation 
with our internal environmental working group which features representatives from across the business, particularly those within identified high emissions areas. The group meets quarterly to track progress, discuss roadblocks, and drive accountability for emissions reductions activities. 
Scope 3 emissions remain our largest 
area of impact, accounting for 98.6% of our total emissions in FY24. One of our key levers for decarbonisation is to use our sphere of influence to reduce emissions within our supply chain.
As such, this year we started to 
introduce environmental performance-related conditions into new contractual agreements with strategic suppliers. 
This will require them to provide us with 
actual emissions data (where available) to help us gain a better understanding of our environmental footprint and opportunities for improvement.
Our shift to the cloud for on-premise 
workloads across all business lines has also delivered emissions benefits by allowing us to close the last of our data centres to operate within the AWS Ecosystem, which uses renewable energy.
This year, we transitioned to providing 
new Australian health members with digital welcome packs instead of paper documents. This change reflects our ongoing digital-first commitment and will provide members with access to critical policy documents sooner.
It’s a great example of how our actions 
can benefit our business, our members and the planet. We’ll reduce the costs associated with producing physical documents, improve reaction time when updating documents to reflect changes within the business (such as product changes), while reducing paper usage and its associated carbon emissions, and improving accessibility for screen readers.
In March 2024, we also moved to a 
digital-first nib member card for our international members, removing the default distribution of physical cards. This change will not only improve the member experience but also reduces the amount of waste generated from producing physical cards and mailing with more than 100,000 physical cards expected to be avoided in FY25.
Despite these positive changes, our 
emissions footprint rose 23.8% during FY24
1. This was due to a rise in Scope 
3 emissions, driven by an uplift in marketing and advertising expenses to support business growth, as well as increased business travel across the Group. Pleasingly, our efforts towards more digital communications contributed to a reduction in our paper-based emissions. 
During the year, we also acquired two 
new plan management businesses and one digital marketplace as part of our nib Thrive expansion. These acquisitions have resulted in a small uplift in our emissions. Our FY24 emissions data is also inclusive of our digital health platform, Midnight Health, due to our major ownership in the business bringing them within our emissions boundary and contributing 7% of our total 
Group  emissions.
A key focus in the year ahead, is working closely with these businesses to support them to reduce their carbon footprint in line with the wider business ambition of being net zero by 2040. 
1. In FY24, we engaged a new emissions consultancy and went through a process of improving, updating and recategorising our emissions inventory to align with 
the Greenhouse Gas Protocol categories. As such, FY24 Scope 3 emissions category data is not directly comparable to FY23 Scope 3 emissions category data 
previously reported by nib Group. 
A carbon neutral business 
nib was proud to be certified carbon neutral by Climate Active for our Australian business operations for the third year in a 
row through the purchase of 100% Australian Carbon Credits (ACCUs)2. 
Our strategy is to choose ACCUs that not only support our environmental goals but have co-benefits for First Nation communities.
Through our ongoing partnership with the Aboriginal Carbon Foundation, we contributed to carbon farming projects that 
centre around savanna burning, a traditional land management practice that’s existed for thousands of  years. 
Beyond reducing emissions, it fosters connections to Country, improves land access for Traditional Custodians, opens up 
educational and employment opportunities in remote communities, and promotes the sharing of First Nations knowledge to new generations.
2. Climate Active certification available at nib.com.au/docs/2024-climate-active-carbon-neutral-certificate
Decarbonising our media and advertising 
Media and advertising accounts for 59.5% of our total Group emissions profile in FY24, making it the biggest contributor to our environmental footprint. 
To help reduce our impact, we’ve built a media sustainability 
tool in partnership with our media agency, Group M, and Scope3 to allow us to better visualise and optimise our digital 
media emissions in  Aust ralia. 
Through the tool we’ll be able to calculate the emissions impact of our digital media activity and in turn seek to optimise through a range of actions, including removal of high emissions inventory and optimising our ad creative. Importantly, this can all be achieved without compromising on the quality or impact of our media and advertising. 
We’re also using our influence to encourage broader industry 
change, by including sustainability goals and targets as part of our requirements in our media briefings.
