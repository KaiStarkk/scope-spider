Important Notice and Disclaimer
This Climate and Nature Disclosure Statement (Statement) 
has been prepared by The GPT Group comprising GPT RE 
Limited (ACN 107 426 504; AFSL 286511), as responsible entity 
of the General Property Trust, and GPT Management 
Holdings Limited (ACN 113 510 188) (together, GPT). It has 
been prepared for the purpose of providing GPT’s investors 
with general information regarding GPT’s performance 
and plans for the future with respect to climate and 
nature-related risks and opportunities.
Forward-looking statements
This Statement contains forward-looking statements  
and statements of opinion. These include statements 
regarding the plans, strategies and objectives of GPT’s 
Board and management relating to climate and nature; 
GPT’s purpose, values, targets and goals in relation to 
sustainability including GPT’s targets in relation to climate 
and nature; and GPT’s future performance in relation to 
climate and nature targets and metrics.
All forward-looking statements reflect GPT’s expectations 
at the date of this Statement and are not guarantees  
or predictions of future performance or outcomes.  
They may be impacted by a range of uncertainties and 
dependencies, including changes to external enablers for 
GPT to be able to achieve its strategies (e.g. technological 
advancements, increased availability of lower-emissions 
energy and building materials, the availability and quality 
of carbon and biodiversity offsets, and policy support and 
fluctuations in carbon and energy markets). See below in 
relation to ‘Uncertainty and estimation’.
Scenario analysis
GPT uses scenario analysis as a tool to understand 
potential climate risks and opportunities under different 
circumstances. There are limitations with respect to 
climate scenario analysis, and it is difficult to predict 
which, if any, of the scenarios might eventuate. Scenario 
analysis is not an indication of probable outcomes and 
relies on assumptions that may or may not prove to be 
correct or eventuate.Uncertainty and estimation
No representation or warranty is given as to the  
accuracy, completeness, likelihood of achievement  
or reasonableness of any forward-looking statements 
contained in this Statement or the assumptions on which 
they are based. Users of this Statement are cautioned not 
to place undue reliance on such statements, particularly 
in light of the long time horizon which this Statement 
discusses and the inherent uncertainty in possible policy, 
market and technological developments in the future.
Such material is inherently subject to significant known 
and unknown risks, uncertainties and contingencies,  
many of which are outside of GPT’s control. Actual results, 
circumstances and developments may differ materially 
from those expressed or implied in this Statement, 
including, but not limited to, economic and market 
conditions; the extent, nature and location of physical 
impacts of climate change or nature-related matters; 
geopolitical developments; policy, legal and regulatory 
changes; technological changes; price fluctuations; 
industry competition; and project approvals, delays 
and costs.
Information is stated as at 31 December 2024 unless 
otherwise indicated. Except as required by applicable  
laws or regulations, GPT does not undertake to publicly 
update or review any forward-looking statements,  
whether as a result of new information or future events.
All values are expressed in Australian dollars unless 
otherwise indicated.
Due to the inherent uncertainties in measuring or 
quantifying greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, references 
to emissions and emissions intensity are estimates, and  
GPT does not guarantee the accuracy of this information.Interpretation of terms like carbon neutral, net zero, 
nature and nature positive can vary and have different 
meanings depending on context. For these major terms, 
we are providing background so that readers have clarity 
on what these terms mean in the context of our business. 
Additionally a glossary is included from pages 45–48 
to provide clarity for a number of other terms with more 
detailed information and GPT-specific context.
Carbon Neutral vs Net Zero Plan vs 
Climate Transition Plan
Carbon neutral means reducing emissions where 
possible and compensating for the remaining emissions 
by investing in carbon offset projects to achieve net  
zero overall emissions, as defined in the Australian 
Government Climate Active Carbon Neutral Standards. 
We generally use the term decarbonise to describe the 
process of reducing GHG emissions and the term ‘Carbon 
Neutral’ to describe the achievement milestones for our 
emissions reduction targets as part of our overall Net 
Zero Plan. GPT’s carbon neutral targets and outcomes 
have a reporting boundary of emissions under our 
operational control, meaning the emissions over which 
we have principle decision-making authority, (outlined  
in further detail in GPT’s Net Zero Plan on page 10).  
GPT’s Carbon Neutral achievements were certified 
in 2024.
Within this Statement, we provide detail on our 
measurement and reporting boundaries for our  
Carbon Neutral milestones which can be reviewed  
further in our Sustainability Data Dashboard.
With regards to emissions, the focus of this statement  
is emissions that are deemed to be material and for 
which we have operational control. Greatest levels of 
influence apply to Scope 1 and 2 emissions and whilst  
we acknowledge that future reporting may extend to 
Scope 3 emissions, that is not the focus of this statement.
GPT’s Net Zero Plan describes our broader climate 
response which includes both efforts for decarbonisation 
and an orderly transition to a resilient low carbon 
economy, so our business prospects are protected in 
whichever climate scenario eventuates. The terminology 
of Climate Transition Plans or Climate Transition Action 
Plans could also be used to describe GPT’s Net Zero Plan.Nature, Nature Negative and  
Nature Positive
Climate and the atmosphere are subsets of nature and 
the effects of increased carbon concentrations affect 
land, freshwater, oceans and biodiversity.
GPT aims to invest in processes that achieve a positive 
impact across multiple systems of nature, while 
simultaneously mitigating multiple risks. Our focus of 
Carbon Neutral Now, Nature Positive Next describes  
our parallel investment in climate and nature responses 
and also that our focus is delivering our carbon neutral 
milestones while taking steps towards addressing our 
nature goals. While we are delivering on carbon neutral 
milestones already, there is still much more to consider 
on the broader nature goals.
Like decarbonisation, nature positive can have numerous 
meanings. At GPT, we have adopted the following 
International Union for Conservation of Nature 
(IUCN) definition:
A nature-positive future means that we, as a global 
society, halt and reverse the loss of nature measured 
from its current status, reducing future negative impacts 
alongside restoring and renewing nature, to put both 
living and non-living nature measurably on the path 
to recovery.
In practice, for GPT this means first understanding and 
measuring the nature negative activities. That is, natural 
environments that have been displaced by our buildings 
and the direct impacts on nature and its resources. We 
will take action to reduce and eliminate these nature 
negative impacts where possible.
Next, where possible, we will enhance natural 
environments within our properties, then finally 
compensate for residual impacts through nature 
restoration projects. Nature impacts will target multiple 
natural systems, such as reforestation projects that 
remove carbon, improve biodiversity and improve  
water quality and flows.
Over time we are implementing metrics and targets  
for reducing nature negative outcomes and delivering 
positive outcomes for nature.
Like our Net Zero Plan, GPT’s Nature Plan is being 
developed to assist us in managing any nature-related 
risk to our business and, where possible, leverage 
opportunities from our understanding of how our 
business activities interact with nature.

Net Zero Plan – GPT’s climate transition
Our Net Zero Plan for an orderly transition to a resilient, low carbon economy, includes both decarbonisation goals with certified carbon  
neutral milestones as well as goals to improve climate resilience. Through our Climate Change Policy, we take actions to support the aim  
of the Paris Agreement to hold “the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels” and pursue  
efforts “to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.” (UNFCCC).
Decarbonisation
GPT has set and is delivering on carbon neutral milestones for all material emissions (Scope 1 and 2) where we have principal decision making 
authority. The table below summarises how we measure, reduce and eliminate, offset and disclose to achieve our decarbonisation aims.  
For further details about our decarbonisation approach for material emissions where we have principle decision making authority, see our   
 energy m aster Plan  and our  upfront e mbodied Carbon Case study .

For GPT, efforts to reduce emissions for corporate and building limit offsets of baseline emissions while offsets  
for embodied carbon for developments are significantly higher
Disclose Independently validate and transparently disclose outcomes and processes
Climate Resilience
Key elements of GPT’s climate resilience strategy considers:
• Detailed climate risk reviews and strategy responding to identified risks
• Asset-level climate adaptation plans addressing transition and physical risks
• Demand-side flexibility and electric vehicles (EV) plans for an orderly transition to a low carbon grid
• Energy procurement framework to minimise exposure to high and volatile energy costs
• Climate-related outcomes linked to sustainable finance as defined by the Sustainability criteria adopted by the debt investors
• Securing long-term supply, credibility and cost for offsets, and
• Decarbonisation strategies that improve resilience to climate-related transition risks.

5.0 Metrics and Targets
GPT aims to reduce our environmental 
impact. We aspire to be an overall positive 
contributor to environmental sustainability 
by reducing GHG emissions across our 
operations and shifting towards positive 
outcomes for nature.
Beyond acting on matters within our direct control,  
we encourage our stakeholders to respond to climate 
change, reduce waste, manage water sustainably,  
and protect and enhance biodiversity. We offer support  
to our tenants with their own decarbonisation and 
nature-related goals and continue to drive suppliers  
to provide products and services with lower 
associated impacts.
Asset-specific KPIs are incorporated into the performance 
targets of property general managers, centre managers 
and operations managers.5.1 Climate Metrics and Targets
5.1.1  Measuring our building’s emissions
GPT monitors its direct climate change impacts and 
reports on emissions, energy, water, and waste for each 
property annually. Our  sustainability d ata d ashboard  
includes a portfolio-level summary for key metrics – 
electricity, water, fuels, materials, recycling and  
emissions – since 2005.
In 2024 GPT obtained limited assurance over sustainability 
performance data, including the following climate metrics:
• Total energy consumption in base buildings  
(GJ) = 507,414 GJ
• Energy intensity (MJ/m2) = 271 MJ/m2
• Scope 1 GHG emissions in tonnes of carbon dioxide 
equivalent (tCO2e) = 6,590 tCO2e
• Scope 2 GHG emissions in tonnes of carbon dioxide 
equivalent (tCO2e) = 21,357 tCO2e (market-based result) 
or 80,128 tCO2e (location-based result)
• Total net emissions (Scope 1 & Scope 2 emissions  
net of offsets) (tCO2e) = 15,802 tCO2e, and
• Total net emissions intensity (Scope 1 & Scope 2 
emissions net of offsets) (kgCO2e/m2) = 8 kgCO2e/m2.
The GHG emission calculations adhere to and are assured 
against the Greenhouse Gas Protocols with the disclosures 
for both location-based and market-based methods 
reported in our  sustainability d ata d ashboard .5.1.2  Measuring our organisation’s emissions
GPT’s corporate activities and business premises  
have been certified as carbon neutral since 2011.  
This certification covers material emissions under the 
operational control of our corporate operations. GPT aims 
to reduce emissions through initiatives such as energy 
efficiency improvements at our offices. Emissions that 
can’t be avoided in these areas are offset to achieve  
net emissions from our corporate operations.5.1.3  Targets
In accordance with ISO: 14001 Environmental Management 
Systems, our climate and nature-related targets focus on 
areas within our operational control. Our approach first 
seeks to eliminate GHG emissions and nature impacts 
within our control. Offsets are used for emissions and 
nature impacts that currently are not possible or practical 
to eliminate. We further enhance environmental outcomes 
by working in our areas of influence, such as supporting 
our supply chain and tenants for which we set targets 
based on delivery of supporting activities.
GPT sets annual asset-level operational targets for  
energy, water and waste, driven by optimisation  
programs and capital upgrades. Medium to long-term 
operational targets are also set at a portfolio level to 
inform energy procurement and offsets. Targets are also 
set for broader performance benchmarks that include 
multiple environmental aspects such as Greenstar ratings.
Performance against these targets is monitored through 
our management reporting systems to assess our 
progress towards our policy goals.
For more information see our   sustainability d ata 
dashboard  and numerous case studies available in  
our  case study library .
