Message from the CEO
I am pleased to share our 2023 
Sustainability Report and provide 
an update on the progress we have 
made on behalf of our people, 
customers, shareholders, and the 
communities we serve.
Customer wellbeing 
The protection and service of our 
customers remain important 
components of our Sustainability 
Strategy.
In 2023, we continued to build on 
our defences against cyber security 
threats through significant 
investments in our systems and 
controls. These expanded security 
capabilities, transformed IT 
architecture, and standardised 
policies have been built to better 
protect customers from harmful 
scams and fraud.
Through cross-industry 
collaboration, we actively engaged 
in initiatives to protect customers 
and explore new intelligence 
sharing partnerships.
We have also formalised our 
Customer Wellbeing Strategy, 
driving further focus on how we can 
best support customers who face 
vulnerable circumstances.
Environmental responsibility 
Having set our greenhouse gas 
emissions reduction targets at the 
end of 2022, we were proud to 
become the first telco in Australia to 
have its net-zero target validated by 
the Science Based Target initiative 
in 2023. Our short-term and long-
term targets were also validated, 
and classified as in line with a 
1.5°C trajectory, aimed at limiting 
global warming to 1.5°C.
We remain committed to 
powering our operations with 
100 per cent renewable electricity 
from 2025, which will put us in 
a strong position to achieve our 
scope 1 and 2 targets, and we have also begun working with 
our partners and suppliers on 
our scope 3 targets. 
In 2023 we launched our Supplier 
Engagement Program, marking a 
critical step towards embedding 
our sustainability commitments 
throughout our supply chain. This 
program focuses on key areas 
where our suppliers can make a 
meaningful impact, including 
Energy & Emissions, Human Rights 
& Modern Slavery, Nature & 
Biodiversity, and Waste & the 
Circular Economy. 
Inclusion and belonging
At TPG Telecom, diversity and 
inclusion are integral to our vision 
for the future. We have made 
positive progress against our 
gender diversity targets and we 
continued to drive gender pay 
equity for equivalent roles.
As we finalise our Innovate 
Reconciliation Action Plan, we are 
excited to have received conditional 
endorsement from Reconciliation 
Australia. We look forward to its 
launch in 2024, continuing our 
dedication to advancing 
reconciliation efforts.
In 2023, we also established a 
new Employee Resource Group, 
DNA (Disability Network Alliance), 
a dedicated group of employees 
passionate about accessibility in all 
its forms, either as people with lived 
experience of disability or as allies.
Together, these efforts reaffirm our 
commitment to building a future 
where diversity is celebrated, 
reconciliation is not just a goal, 
but a lived reality, and accessibility 
is woven into the fabric of our 
organisation.
Digital economy
In 2023, TPG Telecom continued to 
extend the social and economic 
benefits of connectivity to more communities as we achieved 
significant milestones in our 5G 
rollout and continued to deliver 
essential broadband services to 
millions of Australians. Our 5G 
mobile network now has more than 
3,000 enabled sites across the 
nation, covering more than 98 per 
cent of the population in 12 of 
Australia’s major cities and centres.
Our community investment efforts 
have seen continued growth. With 
increased funding allocated to the 
TPG Telecom Foundation in 2023, 
we strengthened our impact 
through strategic grants and 
donations totalling over $1.3 
million. The success of our Skilled 
Volunteering Program pilot inspired 
us to expand our efforts, leveraging 
the skills and expertise of our 
teams to support charitable causes.
Looking ahead
As we reflect on the 
accomplishments of the past year, 
we enter 2024 energised and 
committed to our Sustainability 
Strategy. We also recognise the 
continuing need for ongoing 
adaptation to emerging challenges.
I would like to thank our dedicated 
team at TPG Telecom, whose 
commitment continues to make 
positive progress on our 
sustainability commitments. I also 
thank our valued customers and 
shareholders for their continued 
support and partnership as we 
navigate the journey ahead.

In 2023, we continued to build new mobile black spot 
sites and upgrade existing sites, including in disaster-
prone areas. This enhances connectivity for our 
customers and improves resilience to our network 
in times of emergency.
Carbon footprint reduction
As an operator and provider of critical communication 
services, we recognise the importance of supporting 
Australia’s net zero commitment and finding new and 
better ways to reduce the carbon footprint of our 
networks and supply chains.
This is why we have committed to:
• Developing a strategy and implementation plan 
to support achievement of science-based 
emissions reduction targets.
• Powering our Australian operations with 
100 per cent renewable electricity by 2025.
Energy and emissions reporting
In 2022, we mapped the carbon footprint of our 
operations and value chain for the first time, 
establishing our 2021 GHG emissions baseline, used 
in setting our emissions reduction targets. TPG 
Telecom has now completed a full carbon footprint 
assessment for both the 2022 and 2023 years, 
allowing us for the first time to track trends in our 
data.
Energy consumed (TJ) and GHG emissions 
(ktCO 2-e)
Category 2021 2022 2023
Energy consumed 1,237 1,291 1,342
Scope 1 emissions 4.8 2.8 2.8
Scope 2 emissions 
(market-based)224.4 224.8 226.0
Scope 1 and 2 emissions 
(market-based)229.2 227.6 228.8
Scope 3 emissions 1,327.9 1,473.8 1,235.2
In 2023, energy reductions occurred in our fixed 
networks, corporate offices and retail footprint due 
to site consolidation and a reduction in locations. At 
the same time, the energy consumed by our mobile 
network increased as customers used more data, 
particularly on our 5G network.
Despite the increase in energy consumed, the 
associated scope 1 and 2 emissions remained 
largely flat, due to a reduction in the underlying 
emissions factors.
Reductions in our scope 3 emissions footprint 
were due, in large part, to reduced emissions 
from key suppliers. Emissions reduction targets validation
Our emissions reduction targets, set at the end of 
2022, were formally validated by the Science Based 
Target initiative in late October 2023. At the time of 
validation, we became the fourth company in the 
Oceania region and the first telco in Australia to 
have our long-term and net zero targets validated. 
Our targets
Overall Net-Zero Target 
We commit to reach
net-zero
GHG emissions across our value chain by 2050. 
Near-Term Targets

Supporting our commitment to the Business Ambition 
for 1.5°C  campaign, the SBTi classified our targets 
as aligned with the 1.5°C trajectory. This is the 
trajectory to limit global temperature increases to 
1.5 degrees Celsius, required to avoid the worst 
effects of climate change.
These targets are absolute reductions and will not 
be achieved through the purchase of carbon offsets. 
They require a genuine reduction in the amount of 
emissions released into the atmosphere. Environmental responsibility  continued

In just two years, we have significantly advanced our 
understanding of emissions across our operations 
and value chain. This provides us with the information 
required to drive impact where it matters most. This 
is the result of significant effort across the business 
and shows a clear commitment by TPG Telecom to 
support the ambitions of a net-zero future.
Roadmap to achievement
Underpinning our science-based targets are a set 
of emission reduction pathways which guide 
their achievement.
We expect to achieve our scope 1 and 2 emissions 
reduction targets through our renewable electricity 
commitment. Powering our Australian operations 
with 100 per cent renewable electricity will reduce 
associated emissions to zero. As these emissions 
account for the vast majority of our scope 1 and 2 
emissions footprint, maintaining our renewables 
commitment should allow us to meet or exceed 
our target of a 95 per cent reduction from our 
2021 baseline. 
Comprising approximately 84 per cent of our carbon 
footprint, scope 3 emissions are the most significant 
part of our emissions profile. Through the mapping 
of these emissions, we identified that the majority 
(approximately 95 per cent) are concentrated in 
two areas: 
•Emissions from our suppliers in the manufacture 
and delivery of goods and services we procure. 
These include the building and maintaining of our 
mobile and fixed networks, as well as devices we 
sell to our customers.
•Emissions from our customers using the products 
and services we provide.
Recognising the influence and impact our suppliers 
have in both of these areas, we aim to leverage our 
relationships to reduce the emissions of our 
customers and suppliers. We plan to achieve this 
by working with our suppliers to set and achieve 
their own emissions reduction targets.
Supplier Engagement Program
Collaboration and support from our suppliers is an 
important aspect of our Sustainability Strategy and 
in achieving our goals. This year, we launched our 
Supplier Engagement Program, focusing on 
embedding our sustainability commitments 
throughout our supply chain. 
The program addresses key areas where our 
suppliers can make the greatest impact, including: 
Energy & Emissions, Human Rights & Modern 
Slavery, Nature & Biodiversity and Waste & the 
Circular Economy.The first stage of the program, our pilot ‘net-zero 
initiative’, is focused on our emissions reduction 
targets and aims to:
•Raise awareness with our suppliers by providing 
an overview of our emissions reduction targets.
•Understand the level of maturity across our 
supply chain regarding their emissions footprints 
and reduction strategies.
•Collaborate with key suppliers to set and achieve 
emissions reduction targets. 
In 2023, we developed a net-zero survey, which was 
issued to our top 150 suppliers to raise awareness of 
our commitments and gather information on their 
maturity regarding emissions and  reduction targets. 
Responses will guide engagement efforts with key 
suppliers to drive the setting and achievement of 
supplier emission reduction targets. 
Maintaining strong engagement with suppliers is 
critical for TPG Telecom to meet its science-based 
targets. This helps identify and monitor activities we 
can influence and whether performance towards 
meeting these targets is on-track. 
Renewable energy commitment
We remain committed to powering our Australian 
operations with 100 per cent renewable electricity 
from 2025 onward. Our Renewable Energy 
Procurement Strategy has been designed to drive 
our go-to-market approach in meeting this target. It is 
focused on long-term Power Purchase Agreements 
and Large-scale Generation Certificates, aligned with 
our Energy Management Policy and dependant on 
availability and cost considerations. 
During 2023 we began to execute on our strategy and 
developed a formal request for tender for renewable 
energy providers to fulfill our requirements. The 
responses, expected in the first half of 2024, will be 
used to determine our next steps in the process. 
We will also continue to investigate other renewable 
energy opportunities available to us, including 
increasing our on-site solar capacity where feasible. Environmental responsibility  continued
