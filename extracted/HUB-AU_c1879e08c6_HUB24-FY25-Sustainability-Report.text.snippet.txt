Letter from our Managing Director & CEO
Andrew Alcock
CEO and Managing Director, HUB24 LimitedOn behalf of HUB24, I am pleased to 
present our Sustainability Report (Report) 
for FY25, detailing our progress this year 
towards our Environmental, Social and 
Governance (ESG) focus areas.
At HUB24 we recognise the importance of sustainability and remain 
committed to evolving our sustainability strategy so it continues to reflect 
our business priorities, meet the expectations of our stakeholders and the 
broader community, and remains true to our company values.
In FY25, we made strong progress building on our existing 
foundations and continuing to embed sustainability into our 
operations and decision making. This included reaffirming our 
commitment to the United Nations (UN) Global Compact and aligning 
our approach with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, with a 
focus on human rights, labour, the environment, and anti-corruption.
As a leading provider of integrated platform, technology and 
data solutions to the wealth industry, we are in a unique position 
alongside financial professionals, to empower better financial 
futures for more Australians.
This year, we continued to enhance the customer experience by 
delivering innovative products and solutions that drive productivity 
for financial professionals and provide choice and value for their 
clients. This continued investment was again recognised by 
advisers and the broader industry with HUB24 once again ranked 
Australia’s Best Platform.1
Our people are critical to our continued success and in FY25 we 
prioritised initiatives that attract, develop and retain our talent. We 
strengthened our culture by embedding our refreshed Group-
wide values across all areas of the organisation, ensuring they are 
reflected in how we work, make decisions, and support one another.
This year, we also commenced a dedicated program of work to 
define our Employee Value Proposition (EVP), which will help us 
clearly articulate what makes HUB24 a great place to work. By 
aligning our EVP with what matters most to our people, we aim to 
enhance our ability to attract the right talent, strengthen employee 
engagement, and support long-term retention.
Pleasingly, as a result of our continued focus on the employee 
experience, our people engagement increased from 76% in FY24 
to 78% in FY25.
We’ve continued to strengthen our governance and risk 
frameworks to support the sustainable growth of our business. This 
includes embedding a healthy risk culture, supported by education, 
training for our people, and maintaining robust policies to manage 
risk effectively.Through our HUBempower program, we increased our contribution 
to a range of community initiatives designed to improve financial 
capability and wellbeing, and continued to provide opportunities 
for our people to participate and give back.
We’ve made solid progress toward our goal of achieving Net 
Zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030, from our FY22 base year. 
In FY25, we continued to implement our emissions reduction 
roadmap by consolidating our office footprint into more energy-
efficient workspaces and sourcing GreenPower where possible.
As a technology and data services provider, we’re leveraging 
digitisation to help increase productivity and create a sustainable 
advice industry for financial professionals and their clients. In FY25, 
we continued to leverage emerging technologies such as artificial 
intelligence to enhance the customer experience, deliver scalability 
and unlock insights and data that support better decision making 
for the HUB24 Group and our customers.
We’ve also continued to invest in our cybersecurity and privacy 
frameworks, maintaining a cyber resilience program in line 
with Australian and international standards. Employee training, 
education and safeguards are in place to protect the integrity and 
security of data entrusted to us.
While we’ve made great progress this year, we know there’s more 
to do. We’ll continue engaging our people and partners to advance 
our sustainability goals and deliver on our purpose of empowering 
better financial futures, together.
I’m pleased to share HUB24’s progress and priorities in this year’s 
Sustainability Report and look forward to continuing our journey 
in FY26.

Climate related targets and metrics
At HUB24, we continue to recognise the growing impacts of climate change and remain committed to playing our part in supporting the 
transition to a decarbonised world. As part of this commitment, we have set a target over our direct operations to achieve Net Zero scope 1 
and 2 emissions by 2030 from our FY22 base year.
In FY25, we made meaningful progress toward that goal through a relocation and office consolidation strategy to more efficient premises, 
which will reduce our Scope 1 emissions to zero from FY26 onwards.
From mid FY25, we have opted into GreenPower accredited electricity plans at all locations where we control the energy provider or 
energy mix, ensuring renewable electricity supply for approximately 80% of our total consumption. While the early impact of these changes 
is reflected in our FY25 emissions data, the full benefits is expected to be realised in FY26 and beyond.
Scope 3 emissions have increased relative to the FY22 baseline year. This is due to HUB24 increasing in size year on year with the largest 
increases seen in purchased goods and employee-related categories; both of which represent business growth. Scope 1, 2 and 3 revenue 
intensity metrics have been provided to show progress accounting for growth.
Scope and definitions:
HUB24 uses operational control to determine its reporting boundary, which includes the business activities of its wholly owned subsidiaries.
Scope 1 – Direct emissions from sources which HUB24 owns or controls. In our offices, this typically includes emissions from refrigerants.
Scope 2 – Indirect emissions from electricity consumption, which includes electricity consumed at our office locations in Australia.
Scope 3 –  All other indirect emissions that occur in the value chain, consistent with the scope 3 categories in the Greenhouse Gas 
Reporting Protocol. 
 –  Financed Emissions are not considered applicable to HUB24’s business activities as an administrator and platform. Financed 
emissions might be considered by underlying asset managers.
