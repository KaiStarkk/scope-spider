Ernst & Young (‘EY’, ‘we’) were engaged by  Scentre Group  Limited  (‘Scentre’) to undertake a limited assurance engagement as 
defined by  Australian Auditing Standards, hereafter referred to as a ‘review’, over the Subject Matter defined below for the year 
ende d 31 December 2024. Based on the procedures we have performed and the evidence we have obtained, nothing has come to 
our attention that causes us to believe the Subject Matter has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance wit h the 
Criteria defined below.  
What  our review covered  
We reviewed  selected greenhouse gas (‘GHG’) and 
environmental performance data in Scentre ’s Responsible 
Business Report (the ‘Report’), as outlined in the table below:  
Performance data  Report ed value  
Scope 1 GHG emissions in tonnes of carbon dioxide 
equivalent (tCO 2-e) 10,211  
Scope 2 GHG emissions as calculated using the 
location -based method (tCO 2-e) 175,110  
Scope 2 GHG emissions as calculated using the market -
based method (tCO 2-e) 159,791  
Selected Scope 3 GHG emissions ( limited to waste to 
landfill, purchased electricity, employee commute 
travel, business air travel, natural gas, taxi and car 
rental travel, transport fuels, and non -transport fuels ) 
(tCO 2-e) 72,655  
Water consumption in cubic met ers (m3) (rainwater 
collected, and municipal water purchased ) 4,438,430  
Total landfill and all recycling streams (tonnes)  90,276  
Total D&C landfill  and recycling waste in tonnes 
(tonnes)  12,263 
Total hazardous  waste (tonnes)  149 
Energy consumed in gigajoules  (GJ) 1,223, 549 
Energy produced  in gigajoules  (GJ) 52,438  
 
Other than as described in the preceding paragraphs, which 
set out the scope of our engagement, we did not perform 
assurance procedures on the remaining information included 
in the  Report, and accordingly, we do not express an opinion 
or conclusion on this information . Criteria applied by Scentre  
In preparing the  selected Subject Matter , Scentre applied the  
following Criteria:  
► Scentre Group’s GHG Framework  
► Scentre Group’s GHG Methodology  
► National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007  (for 
scope 1 and scope 2 GHG data)  
► GHG Protocol Scope 2 Guidance: An amendment to the 
GHG Protocol Corporate Standard  
► Climate Active Electricity Accounting, August  2023 
► Scentre Groups’ internally developed reporting criteria 
(e.g., Basis of Preparation).  
 
Key responsibilities  
Scentre ’s responsibility  
Scentre’s m anagement is responsible for selecting the 
Criteria, and for presenting the selected sustainability 
performance data  in accordance with that Criteria, in all 
material respects. This responsibility includes establishing and 
maintaining internal controls, maintaining adequate records 
and making estimates that are relevant to the preparation of 
the subject matter, such tha t it is free from material 
misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.  
EY’s responsibility and independence  
Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on the Subject 
Matter  based on our review.  
We have complied with the independence and relevant ethical 
requirements, which are founded on fundamental principles of 
integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, 
confidentiality and professional behaviour.  
EY applies Auditing Standard ASQM 1  Quality Management for 
Firms that Perform Audits or Reviews of Financial Reports and 
Other Financial Information, or Other Assurance or Related 
Services Engagements , which requires the firm to design, 
implement and operate a system of quality management 
including policies or procedures regarding compliance with 
ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable 
legal and regulatory requirements.

Our approach  to conducting the review  
We conducted this review  in accordance with the  Australian 
Auditing and Assurance Standards Board’s Australian 
Standard on Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits or 
Reviews of Historical Financial Information  (‘ASAE 3000’) and 
the terms of reference for this engagement as agreed with 
Scentre on 29 November 2024. That standard requires that 
we plan and perform our engagement to express a conclusion 
on whether anything has come to our attention that causes us 
to believe that the Subject Matter is not prepared, in all 
material respects, in accordance with the Criteri a, and to issue 
a report.  
Summary of review procedures performed   
A review consists of making enquiries, primarily of persons 
responsible for the preparing sustainability performance data  
and related informatio n and applying analytical and other 
review procedures.  
The nature, timing, and extent of the procedures selected 
depend on our judgement, including an assessment of the risk 
of material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. The 
procedures we performed included, but were not limited to:  
► Conducted interviews with personnel to understand the  
business and reporting process  
► Conducted interviews with key personnel to understand 
the process for collecting, collating and reporting the 
Subject Matter during the reporting period  
► Assessed  that the calculation criteria have been correctly 
applied in accordance with the methodologies outlined in 
the Criteria  
► Undertook analytical review procedures to support the 
reasonableness of the data  
► Identified and test ed assumptions supporting calculations  
► Tested, on a sample basis, underlying source information 
to assess  the accuracy of the data  
► Checked the presentation and accuracy of the subject 
matter disclosed in the Report and the electronic data pack 
released publicly . 
We believe that the evidence obtained is sufficient and 
appropriate to provide a basis for our review  conclusion.  
Inherent limitations  
Procedures performed in a review  engagement vary in nature 
and timing from, and are less in extent than for , a reasonable 
assurance engagement.  Consequently , the level of assurance 
obtained in a review  engagement is substantially lower than 
the assurance that would have been obtained had a 
reasonable assurance engagement been performed . Our 
procedures were designed to obtain a limited level of 
assurance on which to base our conclusion and do not provide 
all the  evidence that would be required to provide a 
reasonable level of assurance.  While we considered the effectiveness of management’s 
internal controls when determining the nature and extent of 
our procedures, our assurance engagement was not designed 
to provide assurance on internal controls. Our procedures did 
not include testing controls or performing procedures relating 
to assessing aggregation or calculation of data within IT 
systems.  
The greenhouse gas quantification process is subject to 
scientific uncertainty, which arises because of incomplete 
scientific knowledge about the measurement of greenhouse 
gases . Additionally, greenhouse gas procedures are subject to 
estimation and measurement uncertainty resulting from the 
measurement and calculation processes used to quantify 
emissions within the bounds of existing scientific knowledge.  
Other matters  
Our report does not extend to any disclosures or assertions 
made by Scentre  relating to future performance plans and/or 
strategies disclosed in the Report.  
Use of our Assurance Report  
We disclaim any assumption of responsibility for any reliance 
on this assurance report to any persons other than 
management and the Directors  Scentre, or for any purpose 
other than that for which it was prepared.
