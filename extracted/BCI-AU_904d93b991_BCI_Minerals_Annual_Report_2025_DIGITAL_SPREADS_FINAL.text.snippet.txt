Jetty head at Cape Preston West Port
Cape Preston West Port
Located on the Pilbara coast, this port 
will offer BCI direct access to Asian 
markets. Haulage can be a major expense 
for resource companies. By having port 
infrastructure on Mardie's doorstep, the 
Company can lower its freight costs and 
reduce carbon emissions. 
The port also results in lower freight costs 
for the Company’s customers. Through a 
21-year transhipment services agreement 
with CSL Australia Pty Ltd, BCI is the only 
Pilbara salt producer capable of loading 
ocean-going vessels up to Newcastle Max 
size, enabling economies of scale benefits to 
be realised by our customers.
With a total capacity of 20 million tonnes 
per annum (Mtpa), and BCI planning to use 
just 5.5 Mtpa, the port provides valuable 
surplus capacity. In a region where existing 
ports are dominated by major producers, 
this opens up a potential new export 
pathway for other West Pilbara projects.
Since opening expressions of interest 
in March, the Company has engaged in 
discussions with potential third parties 
regarding the use of the common-user 
facilities at Cape Preston West Port.The Cape Preston West Port is a valuable asset, not just for BCI, but also for its 
customers, the resources industry and the region. 
The marine package for the Cape Preston 
West Port progressed to 91 per cent 
overall completion, marking several key 
construction milestones. The jetty head 
piling has been fully completed, and 
significant structural installations have 
been achieved, including ship loader tower 
levels one, two and three, as well as the 
ship loader boom. The demobilisation of the 
jack-up barge in July 2025 marked a major 
milestone in the delivery of the package. 
The port remains on track to be fully 
operational by September 2026.

Mardie village
Over 99 per cent of the energy required 
to produce salt and sulphate of potash at 
Mardie comes from the sun and wind.  
In FY25, BCI continued to take meaningful 
steps towards understanding and reducing 
the carbon footprint associated with the 
Mardie Operation. 
In October, BCI submitted its initial (FY24) 
emissions report to the Clean Energy 
Regulator in compliance with National 
Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER) 
requirements. BCI contributed 14,183 t 
CO2-e (Scope 1) and 53 t CO2-e (Scope 2) for 
FY24, which is below the NGER emissions 
reporting thresholds. Objective: Implement strategies to reduce the direct and indirect carbon 
emissions from BCI Minerals’ activities. Emissions and Climate 
Together, these activities reflect BCI’s 
commitment to embedding climate 
considerations into the way we design, 
build, and operate the Mardie Project.  
The Company’s focus remains on 
continuous improvement, transparency,  
and pragmatically preparing for a low-
carbon future.

Financial year 2025 STI scorecard
The following Company KPIs were set by the Board to align KMP performance to deliver 
financial and non-financial outcomes for the Mardie Operation which will deliver sustainable 
returns to BCI shareholders. A profitability test has not been included as the Mardie 
Operation is pre-revenue.
The Risk and Compliance KPI included 20 sustainability targets relating to safety, diversity, 
environmental compliance, emissions, biodiversity, rights of Traditional Owners, community 
development and local procurement.
In addition to KPIs, the KMP are also evaluated on their alignment with the BCI values.Project Milestone Bonuses
In addition to the STI plan outlined above, KMP are also eligible for three separate Project 
Milestone Bonuses in recognition of the achievement of various key project milestones for 
the development of the Mardie Operation. The Board set these milestones to drive positive 
project delivery outcomes. During the financial year, Project Milestone Bonuses 1 and 2 were 
paid to the KMP.
