PlasmaLeap designs, manufactures and 
distributes cutting-edge zero-
emissions chemical reactors for hard to 
abate industries, including agriculture, 
energy and transport. PlasmaLeap is 
a deep tech innovator with a mission to 
significantly reduce carbon emissions 
in the chemicals sector. 
Before adopting OFX, PlasmaLeap used manual 
processes for managing its financial operations. 
With a typical start-up mix of personal and 
corporate cards, and a manual process to 
reconcile invoices and expenses, it created a 
time-consuming reconciliation process. 
“Like a lot of start-ups, paper receipts were the 
norm; some venues didn’t take certain cards, 
others did, so we had a mix of different cards and 
personal expenses. It was a drain on precious time 
to manage effectively, diverting resources from 
the massive scale-up opportunity we have in front 
of us at PlasmaLeap. There wasn’t enough 
visibility for the growing complexity of the 
business, essentially. We knew it wasn’t 
sustainable,” said Chief Financial Officer, 
Nick Bishop when describing the pre-OFX 
financial management challenges. 
“OFX is impactful around budget, cards, and 
access management. It’s particularly useful when 
employees have different seniority levels and 
budget approval. The big kicker is being able to 
integrate with Xero. The fact we could plug and 
play there is a big advantage,” he said. 
“Compared to other platforms we’ve used, OFX 
is much easier to navigate, which is crucial 
when time and resources are precious.” 
“We knew we needed a solution. So that was one 
thing, this centralisation and visibility around 
expenses and allowing reconciliations to be done 
by those that are actually incurring the expenses. The second thing was platform integration with 
systems we already use,” said Nick. 
OFX’s ability to set up virtual accounts in multiple 
currencies, in practically real-time, and offer 
significant cost savings on FX transactions 
were vital. 
“Previously, reconciliation was a bottleneck, but 
now, with virtual cards and automated processes, 
we’ve seen a real uplift in productivity.”
One of the most significant benefits for 
PlasmaLeap has been the substantial savings on 
FX fees and the flexibility of managing payments 
in multiple currencies from a single platform. 
“On our international payments, we’ve very quickly 
earned back the platform fees… cost recovery is 
extremely quick on the platform by just a few FX 
transactions.” 
In fact, PlasmaLeap saved $5,000+ on their first 
transaction with OFX. 
The results speak for themselves.
Since adopting OFX, PlasmaLeap has experienced 
a significant transformation in its financial 
operations. 
Beyond the platform and its features, OFX’s 
onboarding process was smooth and supported 
by attentive client service, a crucial factor in 
PlasmaLeap’s decision-making process. 
“Michael and Melissa from the OFX team were 
fantastic. They guided us through the process, 
especially during an issue with a third-party 
platform on a public holiday. Their support was a 
stark contrast to the generic, impersonal support 
we’ve experienced with other platforms,” Nick 
Bishop said. 
“On our international payments, we’ve very quickly 
earned back the platform fees… cost recovery is 
extremely quick on the platform by just a few 
FX transactions.”PlasmaLeap

The nature of OFX’s business, driven by our digital 
+ human offering, means that OFX’s direct 
environmental impact is not high. However, 
we understand that we do have an indirect 
environmental impact and are committed to 
doing what we can to help reduce this impact. 
We remain committed to taking steps to actively 
monitor, reduce and offset our consumption.
Determining high-priority, high-
impact areas
We use the Sustainability Accounting Standards 
Board ( SASB) Materiality Map for the ‘Consumer 
Finance’ industry to help self-identify issues with 
the greatest impact on the financial condition or 
operating performance of OFX.
In accordance with the SASB Materiality Map, 
we have identified the following key issues:
• carbon emissions reduction; and 
• waste management and recycling.Carbon emissions reduction
OFX is committed to understand the total carbon 
emission output for the OFX Group to assist us to 
develop our strategy to better manage, reduce 
and mitigate our carbon emissions.
In FY25, we have continued to use an independent 
carbon emissions management consultant to 
calculate and report on our scope 1, scope 2 and 
upstream scope 3 carbon emissions according to 
the Greenhouse Gas ( GHG) Protocol. This protocol 
is compliant with the Australian Government’s 
Climate Active Carbon Neutral Standard for 
Organisations and the British Standard 
Institution’s PAS 2060 Carbon Neutral.
OFX calculates scope 2 emissions, relating to 
purchased electricity, using the location-based 
method. This method reflects the average 
emissions intensity of the electricity grid where 
OFX’s energy consumption occurs. Where 
available, OFX also calculates scope 2 emissions 
using the market-based method. This method 
reflects emissions from electricity providers OFX 
has chosen and derives emission factors from 
contractual arrangements such as renewable or 
green energy contracts. Scope 3 are calculated 
on an ‘emission by spend’ basis. OFX’s carbon 
emission in FY25 was as follows.

In summary, OFX does not contribute to scope 1 
emissions. OFX’s energy consumption is limited to 
scope 2 and 3 emissions. We estimate that 98% 
of our emissions are upstream scope 3 emissions.
Cloud computing forms an integral part of the OFX 
business and OFX remains committed to using 
energy-efficient cloud computing providers.
OFX also remains committed to only using air 
travel purposefully. As a global business, OFX 
relies upon and is continuing to explore further 
opportunities to connect to our people virtually 
to reduce emissions related to commuting.
In FY25, we switched our head office in Sydney 
and our office in Dublin to green power using a 
market-based electricity calculation approach. 
Emissions for these two offices are now carbon 
neutral.For FY26, OFX has reaffirmed its commitment to a 
global hybrid working model, and in those office 
spaces that continue to house our people, we are 
continuing to look for ways to better use energy-
saving technologies for things such as lighting, 
heating and cooling, including identifying 
opportunities where we can take advantage 
of greener power options for our offices.
In FY26, we will continue to measure, identify and 
understand the main sources of OFX’s carbon 
emissions, and we are now equipped with a 
year-on-year comparison to help with that 
understanding. We will continue to investigate 
the best way to invest funds towards our goal to 
reduce and, where it makes sense, offset our 
carbon emissions.

Waste management and recycling
Waste management and recycling 
continues to be a focus for OFX. 
In FY25, we have maintained our 
commitment to waste reduction. 
We continue to encourage the use of 
recycling at all our office locations 
globally and have adopted office 
composting where available. We have 
focused on avoiding the use of single-use 
plastics for corporate catering globally 
and continue to embrace paperless ways 
of working through the use of e-signature 
tools across our business.
In addition, we successfully continued a 
technology hardware recycling program, 
which includes donating out-of-
commission technology to charities at 
least annually.
In FY26, we remain committed to 
minimising our environmental impact by 
maintaining the use of e-signature tools 
to reduce paper use, selecting off-site 
venues that provide recycling facilities 
and ensuring corporate catering globally 
is free from single-use plastic cutlery.Top 3 quantified emissions
