Important Notice and Disclaimer
This Climate and Nature Disclosure Statement (Statement) 
has been prepared by The GPT Group comprising GPT RE 
Limited (ACN 107 426 504; AFSL 286511), as responsible entity 
of the General Property Trust, and GPT Management 
Holdings Limited (ACN 113 510 188) (together, GPT). It has 
been prepared for the purpose of providing GPT’s investors 
with general information regarding GPT’s performance 
and plans for the future with respect to climate and 
nature-related risks and opportunities.
Forward-looking statements
This Statement contains forward-looking statements  
and statements of opinion. These include statements 
regarding the plans, strategies and objectives of GPT’s 
Board and management relating to climate and nature; 
GPT’s purpose, values, targets and goals in relation to 
sustainability including GPT’s targets in relation to climate 
and nature; and GPT’s future performance in relation to 
climate and nature targets and metrics.
All forward-looking statements reflect GPT’s expectations 
at the date of this Statement and are not guarantees  
or predictions of future performance or outcomes.  
They may be impacted by a range of uncertainties and 
dependencies, including changes to external enablers for 
GPT to be able to achieve its strategies (e.g. technological 
advancements, increased availability of lower-emissions 
energy and building materials, the availability and quality 
of carbon and biodiversity offsets, and policy support and 
fluctuations in carbon and energy markets). See below in 
relation to ‘Uncertainty and estimation’.
Scenario analysis
GPT uses scenario analysis as a tool to understand 
potential climate risks and opportunities under different 
circumstances. There are limitations with respect to 
climate scenario analysis, and it is difficult to predict 
which, if any, of the scenarios might eventuate. Scenario 
analysis is not an indication of probable outcomes and 
relies on assumptions that may or may not prove to be 
correct or eventuate.Uncertainty and estimation
No representation or warranty is given as to the  
accuracy, completeness, likelihood of achievement  
or reasonableness of any forward-looking statements 
contained in this Statement or the assumptions on which 
they are based. Users of this Statement are cautioned not 
to place undue reliance on such statements, particularly 
in light of the long time horizon which this Statement 
discusses and the inherent uncertainty in possible policy, 
market and technological developments in the future.
Such material is inherently subject to significant known 
and unknown risks, uncertainties and contingencies,  
many of which are outside of GPT’s control. Actual results, 
circumstances and developments may differ materially 
from those expressed or implied in this Statement, 
including, but not limited to, economic and market 
conditions; the extent, nature and location of physical 
impacts of climate change or nature-related matters; 
geopolitical developments; policy, legal and regulatory 
changes; technological changes; price fluctuations; 
industry competition; and project approvals, delays 
and costs.
Information is stated as at 31 December 2024 unless 
otherwise indicated. Except as required by applicable  
laws or regulations, GPT does not undertake to publicly 
update or review any forward-looking statements,  
whether as a result of new information or future events.
All values are expressed in Australian dollars unless 
otherwise indicated.
Due to the inherent uncertainties in measuring or 
quantifying greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, references 
to emissions and emissions intensity are estimates, and  
GPT does not guarantee the accuracy of this information.Interpretation of terms like carbon neutral, net zero, 
nature and nature positive can vary and have different 
meanings depending on context. For these major terms, 
we are providing background so that readers have clarity 
on what these terms mean in the context of our business. 
Additionally a glossary is included from pages 45–48 
to provide clarity for a number of other terms with more 
detailed information and GPT-specific context.
Carbon Neutral vs Net Zero Plan vs 
Climate Transition Plan
Carbon neutral means reducing emissions where 
possible and compensating for the remaining emissions 
by investing in carbon offset projects to achieve net  
zero overall emissions, as defined in the Australian 
Government Climate Active Carbon Neutral Standards. 
We generally use the term decarbonise to describe the 
process of reducing GHG emissions and the term ‘Carbon 
Neutral’ to describe the achievement milestones for our 
emissions reduction targets as part of our overall Net 
Zero Plan. GPT’s carbon neutral targets and outcomes 
have a reporting boundary of emissions under our 
operational control, meaning the emissions over which 
we have principle decision-making authority, (outlined  
in further detail in GPT’s Net Zero Plan on page 10).  
GPT’s Carbon Neutral achievements were certified 
in 2024.
Within this Statement, we provide detail on our 
measurement and reporting boundaries for our  
Carbon Neutral milestones which can be reviewed  
further in our Sustainability Data Dashboard.
With regards to emissions, the focus of this statement  
is emissions that are deemed to be material and for 
which we have operational control. Greatest levels of 
influence apply to Scope 1 and 2 emissions and whilst  
we acknowledge that future reporting may extend to 
Scope 3 emissions, that is not the focus of this statement.
GPT’s Net Zero Plan describes our broader climate 
response which includes both efforts for decarbonisation 
and an orderly transition to a resilient low carbon 
economy, so our business prospects are protected in 
whichever climate scenario eventuates. The terminology 
of Climate Transition Plans or Climate Transition Action 
Plans could also be used to describe GPT’s Net Zero Plan.Nature, Nature Negative and  
Nature Positive
Climate and the atmosphere are subsets of nature and 
the effects of increased carbon concentrations affect 
land, freshwater, oceans and biodiversity.
GPT aims to invest in processes that achieve a positive 
impact across multiple systems of nature, while 
simultaneously mitigating multiple risks. Our focus of 
Carbon Neutral Now, Nature Positive Next describes  
our parallel investment in climate and nature responses 
and also that our focus is delivering our carbon neutral 
milestones while taking steps towards addressing our 
nature goals. While we are delivering on carbon neutral 
milestones already, there is still much more to consider 
on the broader nature goals.
Like decarbonisation, nature positive can have numerous 
meanings. At GPT, we have adopted the following 
International Union for Conservation of Nature 
(IUCN) definition:
A nature-positive future means that we, as a global 
society, halt and reverse the loss of nature measured 
from its current status, reducing future negative impacts 
alongside restoring and renewing nature, to put both 
living and non-living nature measurably on the path 
to recovery.
In practice, for GPT this means first understanding and 
measuring the nature negative activities. That is, natural 
environments that have been displaced by our buildings 
and the direct impacts on nature and its resources. We 
will take action to reduce and eliminate these nature 
negative impacts where possible.
Next, where possible, we will enhance natural 
environments within our properties, then finally 
compensate for residual impacts through nature 
restoration projects. Nature impacts will target multiple 
natural systems, such as reforestation projects that 
remove carbon, improve biodiversity and improve  
water quality and flows.
Over time we are implementing metrics and targets  
for reducing nature negative outcomes and delivering 
positive outcomes for nature.
Like our Net Zero Plan, GPT’s Nature Plan is being 
developed to assist us in managing any nature-related 
risk to our business and, where possible, leverage 
opportunities from our understanding of how our 
business activities interact with nature.

A message from the CEO 
and Managing DirectorYear in Review : Data & Insights 
GPT considers and assesses the economic, environmental and social risks associated 
with climate change and nature degradation. We are taking steps to reduce our 
environmental impact, decarbonise our portfolio and mitigate the potential impacts 
of climate and nature-related risks on our business.
GPT values environmental sustainability by driving 
efficiency, reducing resource consumption and 
pollution associated with our operations. We are  
also investing in restorative offsets to deliver some 
positive impacts.
In 2024, we strengthened the integration of 
sustainability into our operations. These steps 
support our dual aims of being a positive  
contributor to the environment and resilient to  
the physical and transitional risks associated  
with a changing environment.
We acknowledge the environmental impacts of  
our business and will take steps to mitigate them, 
including impacts related to climate change, the 
degradation of water and biodiversity values,  
and the linear economy. To reduce negative 
environmental impacts and take action towards  
our aim of positive outcomes for nature by 2030,  
GPT has established targets, underpinned by  
plans that are regularly reviewed and updated.
GPT has made progress in our Net Zero Plan, 
including achieving our 2024 target of carbon  
neutral certification for GPT-managed operational 
assets and delivering new developments with 
upfront embodied carbon neutrality.We are focusing on our Nature Plan, with targets  
and metrics being established. Beyond our own 
operations, and where feasible, we will work to 
influence our stakeholders, including investors, 
tenants and suppliers, to adopt 
sustainable practices.
In developing our strategies and policies on climate 
and nature, we consider industry relevant goals  
and targets of international agreements such  
as the Paris Agreement.
In 2024, we continued our work on progressing 
positive outcomes for nature. We recognise that 
these are evolving areas and subject to change  
and we will continue to consider and adjust our 
policies as appropriate in this dynamic landscape.
This Statement outlines how GPT is addressing 
climate and other nature-related challenges that 
could impact our business. By understanding and 
acting on the associated risks and opportunities,  
we are better positioned to deliver value, innovation, 
and sustainable growth for our stakeholders, 
including investors.
