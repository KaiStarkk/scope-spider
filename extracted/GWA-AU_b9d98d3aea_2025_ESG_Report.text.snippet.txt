Over the past financial 
year, GWA has continued 
to demonstrate consistent 
commitment to driving 
sustainable business outcomes, 
whilst achieving business 
growth in a challenging market 
and delivering lasting value to 
key stakeholders. 
GWA’s performance is a testament to the 
commitment to integrate sustainable and 
responsible practices within business operations 
and across the value chain. We recognise that 
driving change requires collaboration and 
relationship building with stakeholders including 
employees, customers, plumbers, merchants, 
suppliers and community members. 
In FY2025, we continued to reduce emissions 
from our global vehicle fleet through the 
ongoing transition to hybrid electric vehicles, 
and trialled rail freight in our efforts to minimise 
carbon emissions. Pleasingly, we saw a reduction 
in electricity consumption in FY2025, which 
resulted in an 18% decrease in Scope 2 emissions 
compared with FY2024. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
FROM THE CHAIR & MANAGING DIRECTORWe enhanced our social impact by  
implementing initiatives that benefit our 
employees, customers and communities.  
Our commitment to supporting non-profit  
and community organisations has also remained 
strong, with a notable highlight being our newly 
formed association with Habitat for Humanity. 
By adopting agile work practices, we fostered 
strong cross-team collaboration which delivered 
improved outcomes across a range of strategic 
initiatives and customer interactions. 
Governance continues to be a top priority for 
GWA. Key initiatives undertaken include the 
implementation of a refreshed and expanded 
Enterprise Risk Management Framework,  
which is used to monitor business activities 
within the context of the Board endorsed Risk 
Appetite Statement.
We are proud to have obtained ISO 9001:2015  
certification for quality management and  
ISO 14001:2015 certification for environmental 
management, across product design and supply, 
showcasing GWA’s commitment towards  
driving product stewardship across the value 
chain. Additionally, GWA maintained its  
ISO 45001:2018 certification for its occupational 
health and safety management system. 
We are proud of our efforts in FY2025 and the 
progress made on GWA’s ESG Roadmap, and 
will continue to focus on improvement to deliver 
lasting value to our customers, employees and 
the community.

GWA GROUP LIMITED | 2025 ESG REPORT12
GWA is committed to reducing 
environmental impacts 
both within its operations 
and across the broader 
value chain. This year GWA 
has sharpened its focus on 
emissions reduction and 
efficiency through innovation 
in transport, products and 
solutions, and infrastructure.
GWA’s environmental strategy continues 
to evolve through a culture of continuous 
improvement, with a strong focus on 
four key areas: product stewardship and 
sustainable sourcing, water, waste, and energy 
and emissions. 
The organisation has made notable progress 
since FY2024 in advancing the transition to a 
hybrid fleet of company vehicles, and is trialling 
the use of rail freight. These actions directly 
support GWA’s enablers and reinforce the 
commitment to sustainable growth. GWA is still 
working towards setting emissions reduction 
targets in line with the ESG Roadmap, to ensure 
they meet stakeholder expectations.ENVIRONMENTPRODUCT 
STEWARDSHIP 
& SUSTAINABLE 
SOURCING
At GWA, product stewardship is part of the 
organisation’s sustainability efforts, which is 
reinforced by the continued efforts to maintain 
strong supplier relationships to influence the 
reduction of environmental impacts of products 
throughout their lifecycle.
GWA implements product stewardship practices 
to uphold sustainable business practices 
and ensure long-term environmental and 
social responsibility. To this end, GWA takes 
into consideration:
 •The choice of product materials, including the 
feasibility of using recycled or lower-impact 
alternatives during the product development 
process; and
 •The materials and methods used for 
packaging during transportation and 
distribution of products.
As part of continuing to enhance design 
processes to reduce the environmental footprint 
of products, GWA is in the discovery phase of 
embedding circular design principles across its 
product portfolio through proposed Lifecycle 
Assessments (LCAs) to create third-party 
verified Environmental Product Declarations 
(EPDs). These standardised documents aim 
to quantify the key environmental impacts 
such as carbon footprint, energy consumption 
and resource use across a product’s lifecycle. 
In addition, EPDs enable GWA’s customers 
to assess and compare the environmental 
performance of products, helping them choose 
lower-impact options. 
In accordance with GWA’s ESG Roadmap, GWA 
will be partnering with an external consultant 
in FY2026 to further develop EPDs across 
key product categories. GWA expects this 
collaboration to meet market demand, and help 
unlock deeper insights into the supply chain and 
environmental performance of GWA’s products 
and solutions. 
SUSTAINABLE MATERIALS
GWA has invested in reducing input materials 
and increasing customer awareness of 
recycling, aiming to integrate more sustainable 
materials into its value chain and minimise 
environmental impact.

WASTE DIVERTED FROM DISPOSAL
In FY2025, GWA recycled 52% of its operational 
waste, up from 35% in FY2024. This increase  
is attributable to GWA’s recycling efforts,  
with the additional recycling of obsolete metals. 
Table 3 presents key metrics for operational 
waste which was diverted from disposal.

ENERGY & 
EMISSIONS
GWA progressed its emissions strategy by 
integrating low-emission solutions across 
operations and product offerings. This included 
evaluating renewable energy supply, expanding 
the hybrid fleet, optimising local logistics, and 
partnering with international freight providers 
to explore rail transportation options to 
lower emissions. 
GWA’s approach is grounded in data-driven 
monitoring of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, 
and laying the groundwork to review and 
consider Scope 3 emissions. These initiatives 
form part of GWA’s ESG Roadmap.
ENERGY 
Energy consumption from GWA’s business 
facilities spans across seven offices, three 
experience centres and six distribution centres. 
GWA continues to generate solar power from 
its distribution centres at Prestons, NSW and 
Pinkenba, QLD. 
The Prestons site, equipped with a 250kW 
solar panel system, saw a 6% decrease in solar 
generation in FY2025, producing 314,139kWh 
compared to 334,354kWh in F2024. In contrast, 
the Pinkenba site, with a 100kW system, 
generated 143,025kWh in FY2025, nearly 
doubling its output from 72,728kWh in FY2024. 
This solar initiative helped GWA avoid  
370 tonnes of CO₂ emissions in FY2025,  
up from 280 tonnes in FY2024. ANZ Packaging Material Efficiency
In FY25 GWA achieved a significant milestone in sustainable 
packaging. 94% of products now feature packaging — whether 
cardboard or plastic — that incorporates recycled content, reducing 
reliance on virgin materials. 
This progress underscores GWA’s commitment to minimising 
environmental impact by prioritising recycled and responsibly sourced 
inputs, without compromising packaging integrity or product safety.

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
In FY2025, GWA progressed its emissions 
reduction agenda. Operationally, GWA continues 
to pursue energy efficiency improvements 
and renewable energy integration to reduce 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and decrease reliance 
on grid electricity. The company successfully 
launched supply partner engagement programs 
to better understand upstream emissions and 
suppliers’ ESG priorities, laying the groundwork 
for Scope 3 emissions management in the 
future. GWA is receiving strong support from 
suppliers across the value chain, with rail freight 
providers being trialled in an effort to reduce 
Scope 3 emissions. 
Scope 1 emissions
Aligned with its efforts to reduce Scope 1 
emissions, GWA has expanded its transition to 
hybrid vehicles across Australia, New Zealand  
and the UK. 
Scope 1 emissions are presented in Table 4 below.

GWA expanded its vehicle fleet and accelerated 
its transition to hybrid models, increasing 
hybrid representation to 80% in FY2025, 
as detailed in Table 5. 
Plans are underway to roll out hybrid vehicles in 
New Zealand from September 2025 and in the 
United Kingdom from July 2025, aligned with 
lease renewals. Increased business activity and 
updated emission factor calculations led to an 
increase in Scope 1 emissions for FY2025.Table 5: Overview of global fleet transition
