1. National Australian Built Environment Rating System ( NABERS ) Sustainable Portfolio Index 2025, based 
on Vicinity’s ownership interest and ratings as at 31 December 2024, with 100% portfolio coverage.During the year, we made two 
important additions to our Executive 
Leadership Team ( ELT). Tammy Ryder 
commenced as our Chief People Officer 
in January 2025, bringing extensive 
retail experience, most recently with 
Coles Group where she was the General 
Manager, People & Culture Operations 
where she led the people strategy for 
more than 115,000 team members. 
In March 2025, we welcomed 
Michelle McNally as Vicinity’s 
new Group Director, Customer & 
Asset Management. 
Michelle brings extensive property 
experience, having most recently been 
the Chief Executive Officer of Aware 
Real Estate and previously held senior 
property roles at ISPT and Australia 
Post. Michelle will also oversee Vicinity’s 
investment management priorities, 
focusing on strengthening and deepening 
our strategic relationships with our Joint 
Venture partners.
Our sustainability journey
Vicinity aims to minimise its 
environmental footprint and address 
the effects of climate change on 
our operations.
Having recently refreshed our ESG 
roadmap, our near-term focus remains 
on effectively managing climate and 
environmental risks, enhancing the 
resilience of our assets, improving 
operational efficiencies, and pursuing 
potential opportunities to reduce our 
carbon footprint.
During the year, we were pleased to 
be recognised by GRESB as the sector 
leader across all listed peers in Oceania, 
an accolade that highlights our continued 
focus on embedding sustainability 
into all aspects of our business.
Meanwhile, we remain on track to 
deliver on our Net Zero by 2030 Target 
for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions 
across the common mall areas of our 
wholly -owned retail assets and our 
portfolio average NABERS1 ratings for 
energy and water remain a source of 
pride for us. Our outlook for FY26 
and beyond
Delivering predictable and growing 
income for securityholders while 
simultaneously driving capital growth 
over time remain at the core of our 
business decisions and investments. 
In this context, FY25 has been a 
particularly important year for Vicinity, 
where we made meaningful investments 
in the future resilience and growth 
potential of our retail asset portfolio. 
There is no doubt that the current 
geopolitical environment presents 
uncertainty and risk which we, as a 
Board and Executive Leadership Team, 
will continue to monitor and assess. 
That said, our conviction and confidence 
in our strategy to deliver sustained, 
superior earnings growth via portfolio 
repositioning is not only proven by 
the drivers of growth we have in our 
business today but is further supported 
by increasingly favourable retail property 
sector fundamentals. 
Our thanks 
In closing, together with our Board 
colleagues and the Executive 
Leadership Team, we would like to 
acknowledge and thank everyone 
who is affiliated with Vicinity 
for their ongoing support, most 
especially our securityholders, 
retail partners, Joint Venture and 
capital partners, customers and 
of course, the Vicinity team.
Yours sincerely, 
Trevor Gerber

In FY25, our priority areas of focus were:
1.  Strengthening our understanding of, 
and response to, climate related risks 
and opportunities
2. Driving resource efficiencies in our 
centres, and
3. Further embedding supply chain and 
community impact considerations 
across our business.
Benchmarking 
We communicate our sustainability 
approach and performance through 
direct engagement with our investors 
and strategic partners, and more broadly 
through participation in global investor 
surveys. In FY25, we continued to 
participate in GRESB, where we ranked 
1st in the Listed, Oceania category. 
Materiality 
Our business operates in an environment 
that changes constantly, and it is 
important that we anticipate and adapt 
to these changes, managing our risks and 
leveraging opportunities.
Our Sustainability and Risk teams 
work together to monitor all identified 
material issues through the Enterprise 
Risk Register and regular stakeholder 
materiality assessments and assist the 
broader business to implement measures 
and strategies to mitigate risks and 
realise opportunities. 
In mid-2024, Vicinity undertook a 
double materiality assessment to identify 
our most significant ESG risks and 
opportunities from two perspectives: 
 –the impact of our operations on the 
broader community, environment and 
the economy, and
 –the financial materiality of ESG topics 
to Vicinity over the short, medium and 
long-term. 
This approach is aligned to both the 
Global Reporting Initiative ( GRI) and the 
International Sustainability Standards 
Board’s IFRS standards.The outcome of the assessment was 
a list of 13 material topics, with three 
topics identified as the most significant 
from both an impact and financial 
materiality perspective. 
1.  Climate change response including 
the resilience of our assets 
and decarbonisation 
2. Sustainable design and construction 
to reduce embodied emissions and 
incorporate circularity principles 
3. Resource use including water, waste 
and energy

OUR CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENTAL INITIATIVES
Vicinity is committed to taking action to reduce our environmental footprint 
and manage the impact of climate change on our business. This approach 
enables us to manage climate and environment related risks, strengthen 
the resilience of our assets, support operational efficiencies, and identify 
potential opportunities. 
Our climate and environment-related objectives are to:
 – Deliver our Net Zero 2030 Target1 
 – Strengthen the resilience of our portfolio to adapt to a changing climate, and
 – Deliver resource efficient operations and developments.
Our approach to managing climate change 
We acknowledge that climate change remains a significant global challenge and focus area for Vicinity, presenting risks and 
opportunities across our business, communities and the broader economy, now and into the future.
Our approach to managing the impact of climate change is informed by the recommendations of the Taskforce for Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures ( TCFD ). We are transitioning our approach to align to the Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards’ 
Australian Accounting Standards Board S2 – Climate disclosures ( AASB ).
In FY25, we undertook a comprehensive assessment of climate-related risks and opportunities to build upon the risk assessment 
completed in FY23. This assessment, aligned to Vicinity’s Enterprise Risk Management Policy and Procedures, identified 
climate -related risks and opportunities that may be expected to have a material impact on Vicinity’s operations, financial 
performance or strategic direction across one or more of three climate scenarios and time horizons. The results of the risk 
assessment will be used to inform long-term strategic planning and enhance organisational resilience.
