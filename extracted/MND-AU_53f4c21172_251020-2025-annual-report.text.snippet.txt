SECTION HEADEmission production is predominantly 
associated with fuel used in vehicles and 
plant and equipment required for 
execution of services, followed by electricity as a source of emissions. 
Monadelphous’ greenhouse gas and 
energy reporting uses methodologies from the National Greenhouse and Energy 
Reporting (NGER) Act for Australian 
operations, and the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol for international 
operations. During the financial year 
ended 30 June 2025, Monadelphous implemented a new GHG accounting 
program, which utilises methodologies 
aligned with the above endorsed sources.   
The financial year ended 30 June 2024 is 
the Company’s base year, the year against which the Company will reference 
progress of its Net Zero by 2050 and 
interim targets. The Company’s Net Zero 
by 2050 goal includes Scope 1 and 2 absolute tonnes of carbon dioxide 
equivalent (tCO
2-e) emissions for all 
Australian and international operationally 
controlled sites. The Company uses the 
Operational Control approach to determine the organisational and operational 
boundaries of Monadelphous’ greenhouse 
gas footprint, adjusting for acquisitions and divestments, in accordance with the 
NGER Act and GHG Protocol guidelines.  
A recalculation of the Company’s base 
year absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions 
has been undertaken to address divestments, acquisitions and corrections 
to methodologies. The revised base year 
figure is 7,599 tCO
2-e.  
The Company’s operational control Scope 
1 and 2 emission profile for the financial 
year ended 30 June 2025 was 6,608 tCO
2-e. This includes Australian and 
international locations. During the year, the Company was 
approved for deregistration from the 
Australian Clean Energy Regulator and discontinued reporting under the NGER 
Act, associated with the recalculations 
undertaken for the base year. Monadelphous is significantly below the 
reportable Scope 1 and 2 emissions 
threshold of 50,000 tCO
2-e, and the 
energy consumption threshold of 200 
Terajoules (TJ) under the NGER Act.
Reporting of the Company’s Scope 1 
and 2 emissions continues to be 
undertaken to address requirements of the incoming Australian Sustainability 
Reporting Standard AASB S2 Climate-
related Disclosures for the year ending 30 June 2026.

58Risk Management
Monadelphous’ risk management 
framework outlines the Company’s 
approach to risk and the processes and 
controls in place to aid in the mitigation and management of material and 
emerging risks. Climate risk is included  
in the risk management framework. 
A climate risk and opportunity 
assessment is facilitated annually by 
management from the Company’s Group Risk and HSE functions, along with input 
and review by strategic and operational 
teams and executive management. Management undertakes research of 
publicly available climate data to 
understand the potential impact of climate change on the industries and 
geographical locations in which the 
Company operates, and customer and peer analysis is also performed.
The specific actions to manage the 
identified key climate risks and 
opportunities are noted above. Strategic 
actions are recorded in the Company’s strategic management tool, alongside 
other strategic initiatives and the status 
reported upon monthly. 
Metrics and Targets
Monadelphous is committed to minimising the impact of its operations 
on the environment and to the 
achievement of Net Zero emissions by 2050. The Company’s Emissions and 
Energy Reduction Roadmap outlines  
a series of interim targets towards 
achieving this goal and the Company 
continues to work through a number  
of initiatives to address its environmental impact. 
The Company has an interim target of 
20 to 40 per cent reduction in Scope 1 
and 2 absolute emissions across its 
Australian and international operationally controlled locations by 2030. This is the 
first phase in a staged approach to 
reduce emissions.
The key areas of focus to achieving these 
targets, which are supported by Net Zero 
working groups, include transitioning the Company’s facilities and operations to 
renewable energy sources, ‘greening’ the 
Company’s fleet of plant and equipment and reducing carbon emissions through 
optimisation of operational activities. Activities undertaken during the year 
by the Company’s Net Zero working groups included increasing the 
number of hybrid and electric vehicles 
within the Company’s fleet which now stands at around 20, and leasing a 
25-tonne electric pick and carry crane 
with an option to purchase. The Company also continued its 
installation and commissioning of 
rooftop solar to its owned workshop facilities, with solar installed at 
Mackay, Queensland, and Gap Ridge 
in Karratha, Western Australia.
Monadelphous’ base year has been 
recalculated following the introduction of the Workiva Carbon - Advanced GHG 
reporting solution, the acquisition of 
High Energy Service and the divestment of international company, Maqrent, 
during the financial year, which is being 
retrospectively applied to the base year 
in line with the GHG Protocol guidance for acquisitions and divestments. 
Monadelphous continues to look for 
ways to reduce emissions, and monitors advances in technology which could 
support its goal of Net Zero emissions 
by 2050. 
Greenhouse gas emissions and energy 
data is collated and reported as part of the Company’s environmental planning 
and legislative requirements, and Net 
Zero and sustainability reporting purposes. This involves the collection of 
data relating to liquid fuel use, energy 
consumption and indirect emissions. 
Following the recalculation of 
Monadelphous’ base year, the Company formally requested to deregister from 
reporting to the Clean Energy Regulator 
as the Company no longer triggered the reporting thresholds under the National 
Greenhouse and Energy Reporting 
(NGER) Act for its Australian operationally controlled locations, and 
the deregistration was approved by the 
Clean Energy Regulator. GHG data continues to be captured to the same 
standard required by the NGER Act, as 
this will be utilised for the AASB S2 disclosure reporting commencing in the 
2026 financial year. The greenhouse gas 
data is reviewed to identify trends and used as part of innovation and mitigation 
strategy development for business 
activities. This in turn supports the Company’s efforts to minimise its greenhouse gas footprint and drive performance towards Net Zero. 
Monadelphous also continues to support 
its customers’ ambitions to pursue their Net Zero emission goals, constantly 
looking for ways to decarbonise its 
operations to reduce Scope 1 and 2 emissions produced on customer sites.
The Company has a target of continued 
certification to ISO 14001 Environmental 
Management Systems, with the aim of 
continued improvement in environmental performance. The Company is currently 
transitioning to the Workiva Carbon 
reporting solution for greenhouse gas data collation and analysis, ensuring 
greater reporting efficiency under the 
incoming Australian climate-related 
reporting requirements, including expanding data captured and reporting for Scope 3 emissions in the Company’s value chain. 
As Monadelphous continues its climate 
journey, further measures and targets will 
be considered to assess the effectiveness of its climate-related strategies.

Company’s annual emissions and its

Roadmap, refer to the Sustainability section of this report and the
