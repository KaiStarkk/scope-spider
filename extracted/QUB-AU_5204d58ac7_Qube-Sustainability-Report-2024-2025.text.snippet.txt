Qube FY25 Sustainability Report4Managing Director’s message
I am pleased to present Qube’s FY25 
Sustainability Report, which details the 
significant program of work our team has 
delivered throughout the year across the 
priority areas of our Plan to Thrive.Safety  is the first of those priority areas, and in FY25 
we achieved a strong performance in this critically 
important area. One of the highlights from our 
2025 Employee Survey was that 94% of our people 
surveyed indicated that they understand their roles and 
responsibilities in creating a safe work environment. I am 
personally very proud of the strong safety culture we 
have built at Qube. 
That culture, together with a continued focus on critical 
risk management, the strengthening of our Safety 
Leadership program and the launch of our BeSafe 
program, among other measures, saw us achieve a 14% 
reduction in our T otal Recordable Injury Frequency Rate 
(TRIFR) in FY25, compared with the prior year (from 
7.81 to 6.71). At the same time, both our lost time injury 
frequency rate (LTIFR) and our critical injury frequency 
rate (CIFR) also remained below our target of 1.0  
(at 0.69 and 0.62 respectively).
The physical and psychological Wellbeing  of our people 
is a significant area of focus. We work hard to foster an 
engaging and inclusive workplace, and this year’s report 
highlights the measures we are taking to improve female 
participation, create employment pathways for veterans, 
young people and people from diverse backgrounds 
and abilities into the business, and to advance the cause 
of reconciliation with First Nations people in Australia 
and to celebrate Māori culture in New Zealand. 
FY25 also saw us mark our second annual Thrive 
Awards – recognising the outstanding contribution 
of Qube team members who embody our values 
of Integrity, Reliability and Inclusion. You can read 
more about the 2024 winners of these awards in the 
Wellbeing chapter of this report. 
New climate-related mandatory reporting standards will 
necessitate changes to some elements of our reporting 
from FY26 and the Performance  and Planet  sections 
of this year’s Sustainability Report, detail the significant 
program of work the business is undertaking to prepare 
for these new standards, while continuing to focus on 
the practical task of decarbonising our operations. 
We work in a hard-to-abate industry; however, we 
remain focused on reducing carbon emissions where 
operationally and technologically feasible, through 
operational efficiency, renewable energy and alternative 
fuels, while embedding climate considerations across 
our operations and value chain.
In FY25, we continued to test and trial a host of new and 
emerging technology solutions to help our business and 
our industry identify potential long-term solutions to the 
decarbonisation challenge. This includes trialling the use 
of a conventional diesel-powered concentrate haulage 
truck, which was converted into a battery-swap electric  14%

vehicle (BEV), hydrogen supplement trials, fuel-efficient 
tyre trials and the conversion of various forms of small 
equipment and light vehicles to electric vehicles. 
Our overall operational emissions intensity declined 
by 17% year-on-year; however, our Scope 1 and 2 
operational greenhouse gases increased by around 5% 
in FY25 compared with FY24. This is tied to business 
growth and operational activity, particularly in the 
Qube Logistics division, which saw a material uplift in 
railed grain tonnes. Rail freight is much less emissions 
intensive than road and Qube actively works with 
its customers to encourage the transition of freight 
volumes from road to rail, where feasible, to support the 
decarbonisation of the economy. 
In FY25, we commenced a review of our existing 
decarbonisation programs and targets, to inform the 
development of a new Qube group-level transition 
plan. This plan will include a structured decarbonisation 
roadmap addressing near to medium-term transition 
inputs in line with the new Australian Sustainability 
Reporting Standards, as well as responses to material 
climate-related risks and opportunities and will address 
Qube’s role in contributing to the value chain and 
economic transition. This work is ongoing. 
Finally, the Opportunity  chapter of this report details 
some of the important work our teams have delivered 
this year in cybersecurity, Artificial Intelligence and the 
deployment of technology solutions to enhance the 
safety, efficiency and productivity of our operations. 
From wearable tech to protect the health and safety 
of our people, including those working in remote 
operations to Optical Character Recognition technology, 
Qube has always had an innovation mindset, and we 
continue to take an industry leading approach to the 
deployment of technology.
We are also focused on creating opportunity for the 
communities in which we work, and in FY25 we invested 
more $1.2 million across our operations in sponsorships, 
partnerships and community-based initiatives that help 
advance our diversity and inclusion objectives, support 
our people, or help make the communities in which we 
work even better. Some case studies from this work are highlighted in the following pages. 
Thank you for your interest in the sustainability 
performance of our business and thank you to the 
almost 10,000 people who put on a Qube uniform each 
and every day, who make the stories and achievements 
highlighted in this report possible, and who make  
Qube Thrive.
