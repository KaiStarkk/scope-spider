Embed environmental sustainability 
into our decision making
Our approach 
Achieving our vision to deliver the best health and wellbeing for 
our customers, our people and our community relies on us doing 
what we can to protect the health of our planet. We recognise 
the science of climate change and we appreciate the impacts it 
can have on human health and the role the health sector needs 
to play in reducing our environmental impact. We are taking steps 
to reduce the environmental impact of our operations and supply 
chain and are committed to transparently sharing our progress.

acquisitions since FY21
2.  Medibank’s short term Net Zero target was reached through decarbonisation and offsetting residual emissions (2.55% of the baseline Scope 1 and 2 
emissions) with carbon removals from Delta Blue Carbon, carbon removal project
3. Does not include Myhealth or other acquisitions since FY21
4.  Climate Active certification is a separate commitment to Net Zero targets. Climate Active allows the purchase of carbon offsets and removals, in addition 
to direct emissions reductions to achieve this certification. While not equivalent to direct emissions reduction, we consider carbon offsets are a way of 
ensuring we remain accountable for our emissions while we progress our Net Zero targets. Carbon neutrality covers Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions associated 
with Medibank’s business operations, including Myhealth

Progress against short and

Metrics and targets
Our Net Zero pathway was established in FY21 and is based  
on Medibank Group’s business-as-usual operations at that  
time and doesn’t account for any future partnership or 
investment activity. As part of our Net Zero pathway, as at 30 June this year, we 
met our Net Zero target for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, set in 
FY21, aligned to our business structure at the time.1 To reach 
the target we successfully transitioned the Amplar Health’s 
vehicle fleet to hybrid models and offset residual emissions 
(2.55% of the baseline Scope 1 and 2 emissions) through Carbon 
Removal projects.2 Hybrid vehicles provide our mobile nursing 
and allied team with the range and flexibility to safely drive  
to patients in metro and rural areas and GreenPower®  
for 100% of electricity consumed to reach the target.

to deliver• transition to 100% 
renewable energy across 
our operations
• moved to new Melbourne 
office with 6-star Green 
Star design – in July 
2024, supplied by 100% 
renewable energy • reduce Scope 3 emissions 
generated from purchased goods 
and services by engaging with 
key suppliers to decarbonise 
their own operations in line with 
climate science
• strengthen sustainable 
procurement practices to 
work with lower or zero carbon 
suppliers; implement Net Zero 
travel and accommodation 
initiatives for employees and 
utilise lower or zero carbon goods 
and services • continue to engage with key 
suppliers about  
meeting their own 
decarbonisation commitments
• balance any residual emissions 
through certified carbon 
removal projects aligned with 
the Sustainable Development 
Goals we support that benefit the 
community and the planet
1.  Medibank’s Net Zero targets were set in FY21, when our Board-endorsed pathway was announced, and therefore do not include Myhealth or other 
acquisitions since FY21
2.  In alignment with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) Corporate Net-Zero Standard, we applied a removals-based approach to address residual 
emissions, those emissions that remain after all feasible abatement measures have been implemented. We calculated total FY21 baseline Scope 1 and 2 
emissions and identified the portion of residual Scope 1 emissions in FY25 that were addressed through carbon removal purchased from Verra-certified 
projects in accordance with the Verified Carbon Standards (VCS). This accounted for 2.55% of our base year emissions and reflects our commitment to 
balancing unavoidable emissions at the net-zero target year
3. Myhealth has not been consolidated into Medibank emissions and the baseline has not been re-based

Re-baseline FY21 GHG emissions
In line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate 
Accounting and Reporting Standard (GHG Protocol) and 
in preparation for mandatory reporting under AASB S2, 
Medibank has re-baselined its FY21 GHG Scope 1, 2 and  
3 emissions to reflect acquisitions since 2021 and the  
increased investment in Myhealth.1 As a result, reported 
emissions for baseline year FY21 have increased by 75.9%  
to a total of 27,544.1 t CO 2-equivalent. Our next step will be  
to reassess targets and our decarbonisation pathway.
Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions 
During 2025, our overall Scope 1 emissions were 57.9 t CO 2-e, 
Scope 2 were 1,532.3 t CO 2-e and Scope 3 were  
30,810.5 t CO 2-e. Our overall GHG emissions increased by  
17% due to a full year reporting of Myhealth operations. 
Emissions from the operations of Myhealth are disclosed 
separately as they do not form part of Medibank’s Net Zero 
pathway as at 30 June 2025. Some changes in emission 
profiles reflect improved data collection and measurement as 
guided by developing practices, frameworks and standards. 
Medibank
As part of our Net Zero pathway, as at 30 June this year, we 
met our Net Zero target for Scope 1 and 2 emissions, which  
we set in FY21, aligned to our business structure at the time. 
The increase in Medibank’s Scope 3 GHG emissions is largely 
attributed to category 1, purchased good and services. 
Expanded cloud software and licensing enable scalable 
virtual health services and enterprise-wide improvements in 
care delivery. Emissions also increased due to capital works 
in our Wollongong office and the completion of the new 
Melbourne office.In contrast, most other Scope 3 categories recorded a 
decrease, reflecting improvements in data accuracy, reduced 
travel, and sustainability initiatives driven predominantly by 
our move to our new Melbourne office.
Myhealth 
This is the first year we have included 12 months of emissions 
information from Myhealth GP clinics in our reporting. We 
have improved our methodology for calculating emissions 
across these sites to strengthen the reliability of our Scope 2 
reporting.
The emissions boundary established for Myhealth in 2024 did 
not identify any quantified Scope 1 emission sources. Myhealth 
Scope 2 emissions were generated from operations across 
105 clinics. The increase in Myhealth’s Scope 3 emissions 
was driven by increased procurement activity and a revised 
estimate of emissions from employee commuting.
Maintain carbon neutral certification  
for our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions
Medibank is committed to investing in accredited carbon 
offset projects that align with our sustainability strategy and 
contribute to the United Nations Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs). For further detail on this commitment, refer to
