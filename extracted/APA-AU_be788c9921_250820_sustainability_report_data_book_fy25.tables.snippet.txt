"³ Where there has been no voluntary surrender of LGCs, there will be minor differences in the Scope 2 emissions value calculated between the location-based and market-based methods. This is in part is due to the residual mix factor being applied at a national level rather than on a state-by-state basis. Where this is the case i.e., there has been no voluntary surrender of LGCs, we"
assume the location-based method calculation value also represents the market-based method calculation value. APA has not surrendered LGCs for electricity transmission line losses in the reporting period.
⁴ Emissions for Basslink in FY23 have been applied to FY22 and FY21 as actuals are not available for both years.
⁵ Required to be surrendered by liable entities under the LRET according to the renewable power percentage.
⁶ These values are not adjusted due to re-baselining activity and use the Global Warming Potentials (GWP) from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Report 5 based on a 100-year timeframe.
"⁷ To determine Scope 2 emissions using the market method, LGCs are only allocated to facilities under APA's operational control."
