Greenhouse gas emissions
Resolute has been disclosing its Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 
since 2019, and Scope 3 emissions since 2020. These are 
calculated using the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and 
Reporting Standard. 
Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions have decreased in the reporting 
period by approximately 7%. Emissions intensity, the ratio of emissions to volume of gold 
produced, has been influenced at Mako by reducing the diesel 
consumption. At Syama, emissions intensity decreased due 
to lower consumption of explosives. Land clearing associated 
with development activity and biogenic emissions are reported 
separately. Mako and Syama biogenic emissions were 76 and 
2,013 tCO₂ equivalent, respectively.

Resolute calculates Scope 3 GHG emissions for 12 of the 15 
Scope 3 emissions categories set out in the Greenhouse Gas 
Protocol Standard. The remaining three categories have been 
determined to be not relevant to the business. 
We have continued to work in partnership with industry 
specialists at Normative to calculate our spend-based emissions 
and validate our calculated activity-based emissions using their 
Carbon Accounting software which uses methodologies aligned 
with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol. We have applied extensive 
in-house datasets that use the latest available scientific based 
region and country specific emission factors. The database 
that the software uses for the spend-based assessment is the 
global database Exiobase 3 (an Environmentally Extended 
Multi-Regional-Input-Output database), which is suited for 
environmental evaluations.Due to the change in approach, some substantial variances 
have been reported within some Scope 3 categories in 
comparison to previous years. These variations are not 
unexpected and are consistent with other industries that 
have updated their approach to carbon accounting. The 
variations are attributable to factors including higher sectoral 
granularity and updated economic values for production. 
Further reductions have been experienced due to the sourcing 
of purchased goods from European-based suppliers with lower 
emission intensity, as opposed to Africa-based suppliers in 
previous years. These components have improved accuracy 
and reduced the uncertainty in our Scope 3 reporting. Further 
information on our approach to Scope 3 calculations is available 
on the Resolute website: https://www.rml.com.au/about-us/

Climate financial impacts and management actions
Climate-related risk Financial impact to our businessMateriality over 
future time horizonsRisk management actions 
and strategy
Carbon pricing
Establishment of 
carbon taxes in our 
operating regions 
leading to increased 
direct operating costs in 
the futureand scope of these mechanisms, mining 
companies around the world will be increasingly 
exposed to the cost of carbon. As a result, 
it is possible that our operations and supply 
chain will fall under some form of carbon 
pricing mechanism in the future, leading to 
increased direct and pass-through costs. Failing 
to prepare for this could lead to significant 
financial pressure on us to decarbonise quickly 
to avoid the worst impacts.
We currently do not fall under a carbon pricing 
mechanism, however, both Senegal and Mali 
have national climate targets, and we recognise 
that the Senegal government is also considering 
implementing a carbon tax (although a timeline 
for this is not confirmed1). As West Africa has 
a fossil fuel dominant energy mix, in the net 
zero 2050 scenario, it is expected to experience 
significant carbon price increases as stringent 
climate policies are introduced to curb emissions.
Under this scenario, the direct costs associated 
with a carbon tax applied to our Scope 1 and 2 
emissions are modelled as financially material 
across all time horizons. However, the likelihood 
of this, at least in the short-term, is expected 
to be low. We therefore do not anticipate any 
significant impacts until the mid to long term, 
or until mechanisms are implemented in our 
operating regions.Medium- to long-term 
(2030 to 2040)• Further develop and 
implement our emissions 
reduction targets and plans
• Continue to engage 
with governments to 
evaluate renewable 
energy opportunities, and 
assess feasibility of using 
renewable energy for any 
new operations
• Monitor regional carbon 
pricing mechanisms in West 
Africa, and carbon import 
levies in Australia as the sole 
market for our goods
• Incorporate carbon pricing 
mechanisms into financial 
planning by setting an 
internal carbon price
Flooding
Increases in wet 
season rainfall causing 
surface water flooding 
at our sites, and 
leading to additional 
costs associated with 
floodwater pumping 
and/or deferred 
revenueWet season runs between May to October, 
bringing heavy rainfall and flooding. This has 
been particularly evident at our sites in recent 
years, although financial performance has still 
been strong as both are well adapted towards 
mining during this season. More severe floods hold 
potential to affect our operating costs, through 
increasing the amount of pumping required to 
remove water from mine pits, or lead to mining and 
processing delays and deferred revenue under 
certain conditions. As this is typically recovered 
in subsequent months, there is currently no 
detectable financial impact over annual timescales.
The additional operating costs and revenues2 
associated with changes in wet season rainfall 
were modelled for open pit operations at Mako, 
and both open pit and underground operations 
at Syama. For 2040, a revenue impact was not 
modelled, as planned production at both sites will 
be complete, however, operating costs were still 
evaluated due to their relevance post mine closure.
Across all scenarios, the financial impacts are not 
expected to be material. Due to an overall drying 
trend in future wet seasons at Mako, the only 
additional impacts are modelled at Syama. These 
are most significant post 2030, driven by deferred 
revenue from delays to open pit mining activities, 
although this is not considered consequential and 
will be factored into future operating budgets.Not Material • In 2024, both Mako and 
Syama made capital 
investments in new pumps 
or other dewatering 
measures for wet season 
mining  
• Both sites are already well 
adapted to flooding, and 
have implemented several 
measures to minimise 
disruptions, such as wet 
season plans, educating 
mining teams in wet season 
mining, and establishing pit 
sumps
• Projected changes in wet 
season rainfall will be 
reviewed to determine 
implications for site water 
balance and budgetingPROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT   I  OUR APPROACH TO CLIMATE-RELATED RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES
