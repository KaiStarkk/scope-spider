TELIX PHARMACEUTICALS 2024 ANNUAL REPORT
This understanding particularly supports our mission to develop and commercialize theranostics for patients living with 
c
ancer and rare diseases.
Throughout 2024, we strengthened our environmental risk assessment capabilities through comprehensive cross-
functional e
valuations. Our teams conducted detailed assessments of how extreme weather and climate-related events 
could affect various aspects of our operations. This analysis spanned multiple business units, including manufacturing, 
logistics and supply chain, people and culture, finance, asset and program development, research and innovation, and 
workplace health and safety. Looking forward, we are developing more sophisticated strategies to quantify the financial 
implications of extreme weather events, such as supply chain interruptions. This enhanced understanding will enable 
us to mature our mitigation and intervention plans. These financial impacts will undergo continuous assessment, with 
material findings incorporated into our disclosure reporting. A key priority for 2025 is the implementation of a robust 
methodology to fully integrate climate-related considerations into our business planning processes.
Our approach to climate risk assessment operates across three distinct time horizons. Short-term considerations (0-2 
years) align with our annual budgeting and operational planning cycles. Medium-term analysis (2-5 years) focuses on 
achie
ving interim sustainability goals and targets. Long-term planning (5+ years) encompasses the complete lifecycle of 
our asset
s, from initial concept through to full commercialization.
Through our ongoing assessment process, we have identified that climate-related risks and opportunities primarily 
concentrat
e on two critical areas: asset development and supply chain resilience. The global impact of both acute 
and chronic physical risks, combined with transition risks related to regulatory and commercial changes, is expected 
to have the most significant influence on our ability to achieve strategic objectives over the long term. This 
understanding drives our commitment to developing comprehensive strategies that address both environmental impact 
and business sustainability.
Scenario analysis and future planning
To strengthen our climate resilience strategy, we have developed detailed qualitative scenario analyses based on two 
pot
ential future states: a 1.5°C increase in global average temperature above pre-industrial levels by 2040, and a more 
severe scenario of 2.5°C or higher by 2065. These analyses inform our understanding of potential impacts across our 
global operations and supply chain.
As we look toward 2025, our strategic priorities encompass several key initiatives. We are developing sophisticated 
methodologies t
o quantify the financial impact of extreme weather events on our operations. This includes implementing 
energy efficiency initiatives and renewable energy projects where practicable, while incorporating both qualitative and 
quantitative physical climate scenarios into our supply chain, built asset, and operational decisions.
Metrics and progress
The year 2024 marked substantial progress in our capabilities to capture and report absolute gross greenhouse gas 
emissions. F
ollowing the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, we have successfully implemented systems and processes to track 
both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, using market-based and location-based methods. Our internal systems have met 
all targeted benchmarks, positioning us to leverage this comprehensive data in 2025 to establish our baseline carbon 
footprint and develop science-based measurable targets.
This progress enables us to implement an internal carbon pricing mechanism, providing a framework to assess 
the financial implic
ations of changes in investment, production, and consumption patterns. We continue to evaluate 
potential technological advancements and future emissions-abatement costs as part of our commitment to long-term 
environmental sustainability and business resilience.

with carbon pricing mechanisms and 
disclosure requirements, are driving up 
operational costs and compliance demands

33. Contingent liabilities
The Group has entered into collaboration arrangements, including in-licensing arrangements with various companies. 
Such collaboration agr
eements may require the Group to make payments on achievement of stages of development, 
launch or revenue milestones and may include variable payments that are based on unit sales or profit (e.g. royalty and 
profit share payments). The amount of variable payments under the arrangements are inherently uncertain and difficult to 
predict, given the direct link to future sales, profit levels and the range of regulatory or development outcomes.
On 24 October  2024, the Group submitted and the FDA accepted the NDA for TLX101-CDx  (Pixclara).   As at 31 December 
2024, there are potential milestone payments of US$100,000 in relation to clinical data used in the NDA and should the 
Gr
oup be successful in obtaining regulatory approval.
On 30 December 2024 the Group submitted its Biologics License Application (BLA)  to the U.S. FDA for its investigational 
positr
on emission tomography (PET)  imaging agent TLX250-CDx  in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).  As at 
31 December  2024, there are potential milestone payments of US$1,850,000 to a licensor should the Group be 
successful in obtaining regulatory approval and commercialization in the U.S..
The Group also has certain take or pay arrangements with contract manufacturers or service providers which serve as 
commer
cial manufacturers and suppliers for certain products. To the extent a commitment is determined to be onerous, 
these are provided for within provisions in the consolidated statement of financial position.
34. Commitments
At 31 December 2024 and at the date of these financial statements, the Group had commitments against existing R&D 
and c
apital commitments relating to construction or leasehold improvements at various facilities. R&D commitments in 
future years are estimated based on the contractual obligations included within agreements entered into by the Group.
