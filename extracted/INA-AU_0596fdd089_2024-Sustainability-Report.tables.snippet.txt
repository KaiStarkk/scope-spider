,GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM
,OUR BUILT COMMUNITIES AND BUSINESS
,OPERATIONS.
,GHG emissions and risk management are the core of Ingenia’s
,climate change mitigation and adaptation strategy. We have
,undertaken a multi-pronged approach that includes increased
,"adoption of alternative clean energy options, supporting"
,energy efficiency measures in our built communities.
,OUR REPORTED GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS
,ENCOMPASS THESE CATEGORIES:
,SCOPE 1 EMISSIONS:
,"These emissions primarily comprise of LPG and natural gas, which"
,is used in barbecues and water heaters and is still in use in older
,homes and cabins. New developments are designed to be all electric.
,SCOPE 2 EMISSIONS:
,This category includes emissions resulting from electricity
,consumption sourced from the grid. This electricity powers various
,"aspects of our operations, including holiday parks, communal"
,"facilities within the Gardens, Lifestyle, and Rental communities."
,RESIDENT EMISSIONS (SCOPE 3):
,Resident emissions encompass the GHG emissions produced from
,"the electricity used in the homes of our residents across our Rental,"
,Lifestyle and Gardens communities.
,"In FY24, we continued to focus on reducing emissions"
,and managing climate risks. Our approach to climate risk
,"management is detailed in our Climate Disclosure Statement,"
,issued in May 2023. This statement outlines our Climate
,"Strategy, key risks, and opportunities across the business."
,Appendix A of this report includes details of energy use and
,emissions by portfolio and an update of our actions aligned
,to our Climate Strategy is outlined on page 88.
,We are currently reviewing our Emissions Pathway and
,Climate Risk Disclosure to reflect the significant change in the
,Group’s asset base and business focus since our pathway was
,first established. This work will help us refine our strategies
,and ensure compliance with the latest standards as well as
,consider the Group’s Scope 3 emissions more widely.

EMISSIONS REDUCTION PATHWAY
NET ZERO COMMITMENT – WE HAVE COMMITTED TO
ACHIEVE NET ZERO CARBON EMISSIONS (SCOPE 1 AND 2).
We have continued our progress towards the 2035 Net Zero target which covers our
existing operations and includes an intermediary target of 30% reduction in Scope 1 and
2 emissions (against a 2019 baseline). Following a best practice carbon management
"hierarchy (i.e. avoid, reduce and replace emissions before purchasing offsets). Our"
current focus is on decarbonising our portfolio as much as possible before moving
to carbon offset purchasing.
We will refine our pathway over FY25 to capture significant changes in our portfolio
since the original target was established.

,To assist in tracking our progress towards our 2035 net zero carbon
,"emissions from operations (Scope 1 and 2) goal, a medium term goal of"
,a 30% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions has been set using a 2019
,baseline and comparable assets.
,Pleasingly we have achieved an overall reduction of 18% across the 47
,"assets included in the baseline, despite an increase in occupancy and"
,intensification of the holiday and rental assets. Reductions in Gardens (over
,"50% reduction in emissions), Lifestyle (over 30% reduction) and Rental"
,(more than 45% reduction) have exceeded the target. While the occupancy
,in the holiday parks increased materially in the period (occupied nights up
,"22%), and the addition of new accommodation further increased energy"
,"use, pleasingly the intensity of these assets reduced 15%. Overall intensity"
,reduced 26%. Further analysis of these individual assets and outcomes
,is providing insight into the benefit of actions taken to date and further
,opportunities to enhance outcomes.

In FY25 we engaged expert carbon and energy consultants to review our Net Zero Strategy to
understand our progress towards our 2035 target. The project will explore additional opportunities to
"deliver energy efficiency and carbon mitigation strategies, improved data acquisition and management,"
and update energy trajectories and projections. We will also review our material Scope 3 emissions
sources and Transition risk approach to ensure we are aligned with ASRS and continuing to integrate
climate risks and opportunities into our business decision-making processes.
