We are pleased to report 
that the last twelve months 
have been transformative 
as we implement our 
sustainability framework 
across the business following 
the release of our inaugural 
Sustainability Report and 
commitments in 2021. 
This Sustainability Report outlines how 
we strive to create long-term value 
by focusing on the environmental, 
social, and governance matters that 
are most important to our business 
and stakeholders. The HMC Capital 
Board, along with the Boards of 
our managed funds (HomeCo Daily 
Needs REIT, HealthCo Healthcare 
and Wellness REIT and HMC Capital 
Partners Fund I) and the management 
team, understand the importance of 
environmental, social and governance 
impacts across all parts of our business, 
and are committed to progressing 
the ESG journey we have begun. 
Our key strategic ESG objective as a 
growing alternative asset manager 
of the future remains to create 
“Healthy Communities”. We strive 
to do this by servicing the needs of 
communities through our network 
of assets, by delivering lasting 
positive social outcomes for those 
local communities, and by taking 
responsibility for environmental impacts.
Environmental
It remains our goal to drive high-
performance building design and 
operations to reduce carbon emissions 
and mitigate climate-related risk in 
our managed real estate portfolio. We 
have made a commitment to achieve 
net zero emissions for our Scope 1 and 2 
emissions, by 2028. Pleasingly, we have 
already made considerable progress 
in executing on our decarbonisation 
strategy as detailed in this report. We have also committed to implement 
the recommendations of the Financial 
Stability Board’s T ask Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD) which provides a framework 
to effectively disclose climate-related 
risks and opportunities through our 
existing reporting processes. 
Social
Our social impact strategy is supported 
by both the establishment of the HMC 
Capital Foundation (Foundation) and 
through CommunityCo. The HMC 
Capital Foundation is a standalone 
public ancillary fund which will distribute 
funding to support the social impact 
ambitions of the business. Furthermore, 
CommunityCo aims to work with 
partners to provide support for the 
needs of youth in our communities. 
We have continued to provide COVID-
safe retail spaces for our retailers and 
customers and have consolidated our 
own workspace in the Sydney CBD. 
As part of our social and governance 
commitments, we are proud to have 
already achieved our 2025 diversity 
target of a workforce of 50% women, 
and we continue to make progress on 
other diversity measures. We are also 
committed to creating an HMC Capital 
Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) and 
will work with partners over the next 
year to create and submit a RAP for 
approval with Reconciliation Australia. 
We also will be publishing our first 
Modern Slavery statement imminently 
for the HomeCo Daily Needs REIT and 
are pleased to report that we have 
now joined the United Nations Global 
Compact as we firmly support its ten 
key principles across our business.
Governance
As our business grows, we continue 
to ensure that there are strong 
governance frameworks to ensure 
effective, independent, responsible, and 
transparent decision making in the best 
interests of our stakeholders and all our 
investors across our various platforms. We have responded to the Global 
Real Estate Sustainability Benchmark 
(GRESB) for HDN this year, and 
as first-time participants we are 
reporting under the grace period. We 
look forward to sharing our results 
and progress next year. We are 
also undertaking third party ratings 
and benchmarks for the design and 
performance of our real estate assets, 
using systems such as NABERS, Green 
Star and WELL. We have commissioned 
performance ratings on all rateable 
real estate assets under NABERS and 
Green Star Performance by the end 
of calendar 2022. Rating results to 
date are included in this report.
Looking Ahead
Finally, while we are proud of the steps 
we have taken and our achievements 
to date, we recognise that it is vital to 
continue aiming for higher levels of  
ESG and sustainability performance. 
Once again, we thank you for taking 
an interest in our ESG journey and for 
your ongoing support of our initiatives.

ENVIRONMENTWe achieve emissions reductions by 
integrating climate-related issues into 
every aspect of our investment strategy 
— from acquisition due diligence to 
development design and construction, 
through to ongoing operations.
Climate change presents real risks to our 
business and Australian communities, 
and we are committed to contributing 
to Australia’s transition to a low carbon 
economy. We aim to exceed emerging 
regulatory and industry expectations by 
rapidly deploying technological solutions 
to reduce our carbon footprint.CLIMATE ACTION is an environmental 
theme encouraging us to actively minimise 
carbon emissions. Climate Action 
T ransition to Net Zero  
by 2028
In keeping with HMC Capital’s mission to 
drive genuine positive impact for people 
and our environment, our 2028 net 
zero emissions target contributes to the 
decarbonization efforts that are needed 
to prevent the worst effects of climate 
change. Reducing our emissions now 
helps make HMC Capital more resilient 
to the potential risks and expenses 
associated with the transition to a net 
zero economy — like carbon pricing or 
unpredictable energy prices. This in turn 
allows us to continue delivering value to 
all our stakeholders well into the future.  In FY21, HMC Capital committed 
to achieve net zero emissions 
by 2028 across its Scope 1 and 
2 emissions, consistent with our 
aim to exceed expectations and 
contribute to Australia’s transition 
to a low carbon economy. 
Over the past year, we have made 
progress in several areas of our 
net zero strategy in-line with our 
2028 target, which are detailed 
in this section of the report.
HMC Capital is committed to collating 
comprehensive environmental 
performance data across its 
portfolio to inform management 
action and continuously improve 
performance over time. In this regard 
it has implemented a robust financial 
grade data management system by 
subscribing to the IBM platform, Envizi.

ENVIRONMENTEnergy efficiency
Energy efficiency is a key component 
of our wider ambition to reach net 
zero emissions by 2028. In FY22, 
we began implementation of our 
Smart Energy Management System 
(EMS) which uses artificial intelligence 
technology to facilitate energy efficient 
management of lighting, heating, 
ventilation, and air conditioning 
(HVAC) controls. The system is also 
futureproofed to allow for further 
expansion and integration of renewable 
energy and storage technologies.
The EMS rollout began with pilot 
installations across three locations, 
which resulted in higher than predicted 
reductions in energy use, demand, 
and maintenance. The installation 
of monitoring cameras within the 
HVAC systems has reduced physical 
planned maintenance inspections.
As it stands, eight assets have the new 
system installed and are being remotely 
monitored, with another seven assets 
under installation with completion 
expected by the end of October 2022. All other assets that are able to have 
EMS installed, will be complete by the 
end of the financial year. Results from 
current EMS installations have exceeded 
expectations, with energy consumption 
savings of over 20% - equivalent to 
a 20% Scope 2 emission saving. 
We have also commenced the rollout 
of LED lighting in many of our large 
format retail assets to drive further 
energy efficiency gains across our 
assets. In addition, six sites in NSW 
and seven sites in Victoria have had 
LED upgrades to carpark lighting.
Plans are also in place for the ongoing 
optimisation of building management 
systems (BMS) at assets. This project 
will see the introduction of analytics 
to reduce demand and create soft 
start-ups, night purge, and switching off 
plant and lighting in unoccupied areas.
Importantly, the reduced energy 
usage from these initiatives will 
not impact tenant and customer 
experience, instead maximising 
efficiency, and minimising waste.
