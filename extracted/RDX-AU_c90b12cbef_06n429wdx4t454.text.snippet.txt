The longevity of this ethos is shown by Redox’s status as a long- term signatory to the Responsible Care® program. The 
program is administered by Chemistry Australia and tackles a wide range of issues including environmental protection, 
employee health and safety, storage and transport safety, manufacturing process safety, product stewardship and 
industry transparency and engagement.  
  
In 2024, Redox obtained its latest EcoVadis certification, which ranks the quality of the Company’s sustainability 
management system against global applicants across a range of different industries. Redox achieved a bronze medal 
indicating a top 35 percentile ranking.  
  
Redox’s values are centred around leadership, integrity, hard work, knowledge, service and health and safety.  
  
Redox conducts business in a manner that is ethical, values -driven and in compliance with the laws of all countries in 
which it operates. Redox continues to develop its ESG strategy and intertwine it in its day -to-day business activities, 
influenced by Redox’s values and stakeholder engagement.  
 
Environmental Stewardship 
Redox has a number of initiatives to mitigate the Company’s environmental impact, including through monitoring and 
evaluating Redox’s greenhouse gas emissions footprint, installing solar generation systems in its Australian sites and 
offering returnable packaging solutions and package- free bulk delivery options to its customers and suppliers.  
  
Greenhouse gas emissions footprint  
Over the past four years, Redox has engaged Carbon Neutral Pty Ltd (Carbon Neutral), an independent third- party 
consulting firm, to evaluate and assess the Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions associated with the Group’s 
operations in the previous year. A summary of Carbon Neutral’s assessment of Redox’s greenhouse gas emissions 
footprint for the years ended 30 June 2023 (FY23) and 30 June 2024 (FY24) is outlined below.

1 Carbon Neutral Report for Redox’s FY23 operations prepared by Carbon Neutral as updated at 18 January 2024. 
Carbon Neutral Report for Redox’s FY24 operations prepared by Carbon Neutral as at 3 October 2024.  
2 Carbon Neutral has used the Greenhouse Gas Protocol to categorise greenhouse gas emissions associated with 
Redox’s operations into ‘scope’. Due to the inherent uncertainty and limitations in measuring greenhouse gas 
emissions, all emissions data or referen ces to emissions volumes (including ratios or percentages) are estimates 
based on available information and calculation methodologies. Greenhouse gas emissions are reported as units of 
carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2 -e), which provides the ability to compa re various greenhouse gases as a single 
unit. 
3 To calculate Redox’s scope 1 and 2 emissions, except as specified below, Carbon Neutral has used the 
methodology and emission factors presented by the Australian Government’s Australian National Greenhouse 
Accounts (NGA) Factors. In calculating scope 1 emi ssions associated with fleet fuel consumption, Carbon Neutral 
used emission factors published by DBEIS (GOV, UK). In calculating scope 2 emissions associated with electricity 
use in locations outside of Australia, Carbon Neutral sourced the emission factor  for Malaysia from the Institute for 
Global Environmental Strategies, the emission factor for the United States from the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency and the emission factor for New Zealand from the Ministry of Environment.  
4 Fuel consumption (stationary) includes diesel and LPG fuel usage by stationary equipment such as forklifts.  
5 Scope 3 emissions are difficult to estimate due to their indirect nature. To calculate Redox’s scope 3 emissions, 
Carbon Neutral has used a variety of sources, with methodologies following the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate 
Value Chain Accounting and Re porting Standard (Scope 3) (including applying the principles of relevance, 
completeness, consistency, transparency and accuracy). The scope of the report does not include the carbon 
generated from production or packaging of the products we sell. Scope 3, category 1 emissions are incomplete and 
do not include the GHG emissions from the products sold.

7 Solar power generation  
In 2017, in consultation with its landlords, Redox commenced a long- term project to progressively fit its Australian sites 
with solar generation systems. Redox has since completed projects to fit out six of its seven Australian sites with 
photovoltaic solar generation systems, with the last one being completed in May 2023. Redox’s total generation capacity 
is now 600kW across those six sites. As part of our emissions reduction strategy, Redox will be committing further 
investment in solar power generation.  
  
Waste management and product stewardship  
As an operator of manufacturing and warehouse facilities, Redox is required to adhere to strict environmental regulations 
and licence conditions. The business actively seeks pragmatic opportunities to prevent or minimise its impacts on the 
environment, taking a risk -based approach to environmental management.  
  
Redox has clear waste management and disposal procedures for all its managed sites. Regulatory affairs employees 
regularly review applicable environmental legislation and regulation changes in relation to waste management and 
disposal to ensure all waste is appropriately classified and managed. Hazardous waste is classified by authorised 
personnel and is appropriately disposed of by suppliers who are licensed to accept waste for treatment by the 
environmental authority in each jurisdiction.  
  
Redox is also cognisant of its environmental responsibility to minimise the impacts of its product packaging in the waste 
stream.  
  
In order to reduce the generation of waste associated with its operations, Redox offers returnable packaging solutions 
and package- free bulk delivery options to its customers, with a preference for the use of returnable hire pallets and 
pooled equipment. In many of its locations Redox utilises reconditioned drums and Intermediate Bulk Containers (IBCs) 
which are able to be refilled and returned multiple times. Redox also utilises pneumatic and liquid tanker deliveries which 
are able to facilitate deliveries  without the creation of packaging waste.  
  
Redox has been a part of the DrumMUSTER stewardship programme since 2012. The program provides 
an environmentally friendly way of disposing empty farming containers across rural Australia, using approved 
processors  who divert material away from landfill for recycling. In the period January 2020 to March 2024, Redox paid 
levies for  the collection and disposal of 27,653 x 20 litre drums and 4,738 x 200 litre drums (over 80.5 tonnes of material) 
in support of that programme.  
  
In New Zealand, Redox has joined the Agrecovery Product Stewardship Programme as of February 2025. The 
programme enables the collection and recycling of woven polypropylene bags (Woven PP) under guidelines set by New 
Zealand’s Ministry for the Environment.  
  
Redox is a member of The Australian Packaging Covenant Organisation (APCO) and is in the process of working 
towards contributing to national targets*. The business has submitted its annual report for the reporting period January 
to December 2024 and its 2025 action plan to APCO.
