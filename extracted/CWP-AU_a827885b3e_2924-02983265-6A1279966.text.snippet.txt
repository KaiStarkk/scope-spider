Annual Report 2025
Climate Reporting Preparedness 
Australia’s climate reporting framework is now 
active, with Group 1 companies entering their first 
reporting year. In FY2026, Cedar Woods will prioritise 
preparation for future climate disclosures, with a 
particular focus on Scope 3 emissions. Key initiatives 
will include system development, data collection, 
emissions verification, and building internal reporting 
capability. Although our formal reporting obligations 
are expected to begin in FY2027, we plan to conduct 
preliminary dry runs on project-related emissions by 
the end of FY2026. 
Environmental Law Reform – 
Retaining and Restoring Biodiversity 
Australia’s environmental regulatory landscape 
continues to be the subject of significant reform.  
The Federal Government’s second round of changes 
to national environmental laws aim to: establish 
national environmental standards; streamline approval 
processes; promote regional environmental planning; 
improve offset frameworks; enhance data availability 
and transparency. Cedar Woods currently has three 
projects under Federal environmental approval, with 
a fourth progressing through environmental impact 
assessment. We continue to engage proactively with 
regulators to ensure our projects align with evolving 
environmental standards and policy expectations.
Affordable Housing Delivery
The national focus on affordable and diverse housing 
intensified this year, supported by several Federal 
and State initiatives, including the Housing Australia 
Future Fund (HAFF), aimed at increasing social 
and affordable housing supply. Cedar Woods, in 
partnership with HousingFirst and the Victorian and 
Commonwealth Governments, is delivering a 100% 
community housing project in Noble Park, Victoria. 
The project, located on a 2,211m² site, will feature 
a five-storey residential building comprising 97 
apartments and six ground-floor retail spaces.  
Funded through the HAFF, the National Housing 
Accord Facility, and Victoria’s Big Housing Build,  
the project is set to provide safe, affordable homes 
and is expected to welcome residents by late 2026. Bushmead South, Bushmead WA
