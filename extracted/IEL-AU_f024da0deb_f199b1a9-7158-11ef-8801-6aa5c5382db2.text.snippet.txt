Reporting methodology
IDP’s reported emissions are calculated according to the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol methodology. For Scope 1 
and 2 calculations, we utilise emissions factors consistent with those required under the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Scheme, to the extent possible. Our Scope 2 emissions are location-based metrics and we do not 
currently calculate Scope 2 market-based emissions. This will be included within our roadmap of activities to comply 
with the requirements of ASRS within the required timeframe.
We continue to evolve our internal reporting processes to improve the cadence and frequency of emissions metrics 
calculations as well as data quality. This year, our Group Internal Audit team also conducted a review of the processes and controls of our emissions reporting. The findings of the audit concluded that controls were sufficient to ensure quality of our emissions reporting and calculation of metrics, however recommended additional controls to 
further strengthen the process. These recommendations will be implemented within the FY25 financial year.Our emissions 
IDP’s extensive global operations generate greenhouse 
gas emissions throughout our value chain which contributes to its concentration in the atmosphere, 
driving climate change. Our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions
3 
are our most important metrics that we measure and 
report on an ongoing basis.
Our business model and strategy is focused on our 
global reach and engaging with more people in 
more places around the world. While a large part of this strategy is delivered through technology and innovation, our strength and value come from our network of offices and locations for students 
and customers to interact with our team of trusted 
counsellors and access secure and trusted language testing. This operating model continues to shape our emissions profile; the majority of emissions coming 
from Scope 3 categories and emissions increasing in 
line with the growth of our business and the expansion of our network locations since we began reporting emissions in FY20.

3. Scope 1 and 2 emissions are those associated with fuels (such as 
natural gas, petrol, or diesel) and grid electricity we use directly as part of our operations. Scope 3 emissions are the indirect upstream and downstream emissions from value chain activities.
