Reflections from our CEO and SHSD Committee Chairperson  
Our mining activities often impact our host communities and the 
environment in which they live. Successfully embedding sustainability 
considerations and practices into our business, to both manage these 
impacts and drive positive outcomes, is intrinsic to Gold Fields’ 
long-term performance and success.
Responsible mining is embedded in pillar 2 of Gold Fields’ strategy to 
deliver positive social and environmental impact. This is supported by 
our 2030 targets, which include three social and three environmental 
priority areas. Our primary environmental commitment to communities is 
to ensure that we uphold the highest standards of environmental 
stewardship – a commitment we have successfully achieved for almost 
a decade by having zero serious environmental incidents. This is further 
supported by our 2030 targets related to climate change, water 
stewardship and tailings management to ensure we responsibly 
manage our natural resources and mitigate our impact on the 
environment.
Gold Fields have adopted these programmes, targets and policies 
because they made sense for our business then, and continue to make 
sense for our business today. They form the foundation of our social 
licences to operate, which must endure beyond political, regulatory or 
economic cycles. This commitment is reflected in our reporting, as we 
aim for transparency in our disclosures to enable our stakeholders to 
clearly understand our performance, risks and opportunities.
Gold Fields’ decarbonisation journey, which commenced in 2016, was 
driven by the need to secure our operations’ electricity supply and 
mitigate rapidly rising energy costs. Our investment in renewable 
energy microgrids is proving to be a valuable business solution while, 
at the same time, addressing one of the most critical challenges facing 
society: climate change.Applying a commercial lens has always been critical and our 
decarbonisation work prioritises energy resilience and cost-effective 
reduction in emissions while optimising operational efficiency and 
maintaining business sustainability. At the same time, we have adopted 
a portfolio-based view of our decarbonisation efforts, critically 
assessing where the greatest opportunities lie to enhance operational 
flexibility and energy security and meet our carbon reduction priorities.
In doing this, we ensure capital resources are allocated efficiently by 
applying rigorous capital allocation criteria to these investments across 
our portfolio. Our two largest investments in renewables – South 
Deep’s Khanyisa solar plant, commissioned in late 2022, and the 
St Ives renewable energy project currently under construction – will 
both substantially reduce Scope 1 and 2 carbon emissions for these 
operations while also creating long-term energy resilience at reduced 
costs. 
To date, three of our Australian mines and South Deep have renewable 
electricity sources, while Cerro Corona in Peru and the Windfall project 
in Canada are fully supplied by hydropower. We have seen the benefits 
of these investments, with 18% of our electricity derived from renewable 
sources in 2024, compared with 3% in 2016. Our Scope 1 and 2 
emissions are now 4% below the 2016 baseline.
Our largest investment in renewables to date is expected to improve 
these metrics further, with construction of the US$195m solar and wind 
energy project at St Ives currently underway. The plant is scheduled for 
commissioning in early 2026. Through this investment, 73% of the 
mine’s electricity will be sourced from renewable energy – reducing the 
mine’s future Scope 1 and 2 emissions by approximately 50% a year 
and the Group’s emissions by 6% a year. It will also lead an estimated 
operating cost reduction of US$67/oz a year for the mine and  affords 
long-term operational flexibility to this cornerstone asset in our portfolio.
Our other operations are also investigating potential for further 
renewable electricity sources, but we will only proceed with these 
where it makes technical and commercial sense to do so.
During 2023, we set a Scope 3 emission target: a net 10% reduction by 
2030 against a 2022 baseline. At the time, these emissions comprised 
36% of our overall emissions. While it is still early days, we continued to 
work towards this target in 2024 through extensive engagement with 
our main suppliers.Among our other environmental priorities, we focused our work in 
areas where we impact our stakeholders directly – namely, how we 
manage our tailings facilities and how we treat the water we require for 
our operations and for use by our neighbouring communities. For both 
these focus areas, we have teams conducting industry-leading work to 
achieve our 2030 targets.  
We discuss our 2030 environmental, social and governance (ESG) 
targets, as well as our performance against these, in detail throughout 
our reporting suite. Given that the strategies, programmes and 
initiatives to achieve our targets were established based on the 
knowledge and expectations of technology maturity in 2021, we have 
now initiated a mid-term review to be concluded in 2025. This review 
will assess our progress, future business models and technology 
readiness profiles. It will also help identify any gaps to deliver on the 
targets and support their extension to 2035 to accommodate portfolio 
growth and evolving technological capabilities.
Having reviewed our performance over the year, we are more 
convinced than ever that our continued commitment to a sound 
environmental and social performance benefits our stakeholders, 
including host communities, and the business, and will translate into 
more sustainable returns for our shareholders.

2024 highlights and performance against 2030 targets
Sustainability has long been part of Gold Fields’ way of doing business, with sustainability-related considerations and practices integrated into the operational management of our mines. The table below summarises our 2024 
highlights and performance against the 2030 ESG targets, as well as the relevant climate and environment-related key performance indicators (KPIs) incorporated into our two sustainability-linked five-year loans – a US$1.2bn 
revolving credit facility (RCF) and A$500 m Australian syndicated credit facility (collectively the sustainability-linked credit facilities).

 1  A Level 3 incident results in limited non-conformance or non-compliance, with ongoing but limited environmental impact. Level 4 and 5 incidents include major non-conformances or non-compliances, which could result in long-term environmental harm 
2 Absolute emission reductions relate to emission reduction from a projected business as usual emission trajectory based on production growth rate
3   In 2024, one of the three targets was met: the percentage of women in the total workforce. Consequently, the interest rates on the sustainability-linked credit facilities will increase by 0.025% per annum in accordance with the terms
4  Calculated in accordance with the standards published by the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting and Reporting Standard 
5    Statement by the Carbon Trust: the Carbon Trust assessed Gold Fields’ net emissions reduction target against internationally-recognised pathways aligned with achieving no more than 1.5°C global warming by 2050. Four pathways were considered, the 
SBTi absolute contraction (AC) pathway for absolute emissions, SBTi AC pathway for emissions intensity, Transition Pathway Initiative emissions intensity pathway for diversified mining and the International Energy Agency Net Zero Emissions (IEA NZE) by 
2050 pathway for absolute emissions. The assessment concluded that Gold Fields’ business as usual emissions forecast is closely aligned to the TPI 1.5C emissions intensity pathway. Th e TPI 1.5C trajectory for the diversified mining sector is based on 
IEA Net Zero Emissions Scenarios
