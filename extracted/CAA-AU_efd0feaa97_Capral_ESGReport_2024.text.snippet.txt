We are committed to reducing 
emissions, enhancing circularity, 
and minimising waste.
Sustainability
In 2021 Capral embarked upon a journey to lower 
carbon emissions across our operations. Reducing our 
environmental impact is an essential element of our 
corporate responsibility framework and our vision for a 
sustainable future. Our Sustainability Roadmap is 
closely aligned with the UN Sustainable Development 
Goals and the Global Reporting Initiative. This year, we 
have taken significant steps to enhance transparency 
and accountability in our reporting and day-to-day 
operations.
Our improved clarity of greenhouse gas emissions 
across Scope 1, 2, and 3 is a significant development. 
We have refined our tracking systems to deliver 
comprehensive data on our emissions, from cradle to 
gate. Capral's IMS incorporates lifecycle assessments 
and tracking of Scope 3 emissions, giving a more 
complete picture of our environmental impact. This 
increased transparency not only supports our internal 
targets but also provides our customers with accurate 
insights into the ecological footprint of our operations.
Our ongoing efforts to reduce emissions are supported 
by strategic investments in energy-efficient 
technologies and a gradual transition towards 
renewable energy sources. The advancements 
achieved in lowering carbon emissions across our 
operations demonstrates our commitment to meeting 
our long-term sustainability goals.Capral’s lower carbon aluminium, marketed under 
our proprietary LocAl® brand, has gained substantial 
industry interest and has reinforced Capral's 
position as the leader in sustainable aluminium 
extrusion production in Australia. Combined with 
our Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI) 
certification, this underlines our commitment to 
producing more sustainable materials. We have 
initiated the process of aligning our sustainability 
reporting with the Australian Sustainability 
Reporting Standards (ASRS). This will ensure that 
our environmental performance data is accurate 
and transparent to our stakeholders. This year, to 
align with ASRS, we are reporting calendar year 
sustainability data to line-up with Capral’s 
December financial year. 
Alongside these initiatives, we have been evaluating 
the inclusion of recycled content aluminium into our 
process. This is a component of our broader 
commitment to enhancing our circular economy, 
optimising resource utilisation, and minimising 
waste across our operations.
Through these initiatives Capral is advancing its 
sustainability position and will keep our 
stakeholders informed as we progress towards a 
more sustainable future.

In 2022, Capral’s baseline Scope 1 (gas) and Scope 2 
emissions (electricity) totalled 38360t. Total emissions 
fell in 2023 to 36,690t, and in 2024 they fell a further 9% 
to 33,320t. These reductions are a result of our targeted 
emission reduction strategies. In 2022, Capral’s 
emissions intensity was 0.67 tCO₂e per tonne of 
aluminium produced. This fell to 0.64 in 2023, and a 
further 5% to 0.61 in 2024.
Capral’s target is net zero by 2050 with an interim target 
of a 20% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030. We are 
currently tracking ahead of that target due to emission 
reduction initiatives, such as; operational energy 
efficiency programs, process improvements, and an 
increased mix of renewable energy sources. Ongoing 
investments in low-carbon technologies, further process 
optimisations, and an increasing use of renewable 
energy will drive future reductions.Environmental Impact and
