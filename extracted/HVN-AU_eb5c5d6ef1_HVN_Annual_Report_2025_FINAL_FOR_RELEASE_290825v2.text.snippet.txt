Directors’ Report  Sustainability Report (continued)Places
The Harvey Norman® global footprint of franchised complexes 
and overseas company-operated stores underpins its integrated 
retail, franchise, property, and digital strategy. With 195 franchised complexes in Australia and 121 company-operated stores across seven international markets, Harvey Norman
® continues to invest 
in modern, customer-centric retail environments that reflect its commitment to quality and innovation.
The physical footprint is central to both commercial performance 
and sustainability goals. The ongoing refit program ensures stores remain energy-efficient, contemporary, and compliant with evolving environmental standards. Regular maintenance and upgrades enhance operational efficiency and customer experience.
Warehouse infrastructure is also designed with sustainability in 
mind. Initiatives such as waste takeback programs, recycling, and optimised delivery logistics reduce environmental impact and improve supply chain efficiency.To support the Places pillar, relevant controlled entities and independent franchisees engage with the following organisations to advance environmental and social responsibility:
• Energy Users Association of Australia
•
 National Retailers Association
•
 Australian Bedding Stewardship Council
•
 Consumer Electronics Association
•
 Australian Packaging Covenant
•
 Retail Excellence Ireland
•
 Retail NZ’s Sustainability Group
•

New ZealandSites diverted 37% of waste from landfill, a 20% 
improvement year-on-year. E-waste collection trials are underway at four locations. The method bin trial was not extended beyond the pilot phase.
SingaporeSites continued participation in the E-waste Extended Producer Responsibility Scheme, offering in-store and at-home collection services for electronic waste.
IrelandStores collected over 1.5 tonnes of e-waste under the WEEE scheme and have diverted more than 15,000 tonnes since 2017. They expanded mattress and soft furnishings recycling and continued to collect cardboard, plastic, ink cartridges, and polystyrene.
United KingdomNorthern Ireland and the new Merry Hill store in England offer mattress recycling through Usel, which disassembles and recycles component materials.
CroatiaStores recycled paper, cardboard, wood, damaged goods, and construction waste. Municipal services manage e-waste and plastics. Landlords upgraded buildings to improve resilience to extreme weather.
SloveniaSolar panels at five retail sites generated over 1,200,000 kWh in FY2025, covering 13% of electricity needs. Stores continued participation in national recycling programs for electronics, batteries, and packaging.
AustraliaA controlled entity recycled over 5,800 kg of pre-consumer textile waste through Textile Recyclers Australia and launched a post-consumer textile takeback program at selected stores. A controlled entity manufacturing shopfitting materials uses FSC-certified particle board and recycles off-cuts. It also refurbishes used fixtures for redeployment, reducing emissions from new production.
Other controlled entities achieved a 24% landfill diversion 
rate (May 2024–April 2025), up 86bps year-on-year.  
Office locations, with lower recycling volumes, impacted the overall rate.

Directors’ Report  Sustainability Report (continued)Independent Franchisees in Australia
Relevant franchisees maintained a 42% waste diversion rate, with 
cardboard as the primary contributor. E-waste volumes rose 12% year-on-year by May 2025, and polystyrene collections reached 96% of FY24 levels.
Relevant franchisees selling mattresses remained members of 
the Australian Bedding Stewardship Council (ABSC) and, where feasible, offered recycling through ABSC-accredited providers. In FY25, they diverted 12,553 mattresses from landfill, recovering over 242 tonnes of recyclable materials.Climate Change Impact and Resilience
In FY25, some sites experienced minor disruptions due to extreme weather. Cyclone Alfred temporarily closed franchised complexes in southeast Queensland and northern NSW. Most sites resumed operations quickly after the event. Franchisees in high-risk areas have access to temporary generators, flood barriers, and sandbags. Sites with surrounding vegetation conduct regular roof and gutter maintenance to prevent water ingress.
Company-operated stores in New Zealand, Slovenia, and Ireland 
reported minor supply chain disruptions due to weather, with no material impact on operations or revenue.

Directors’ Report  Sustainability Report (continued)Products
Delivering high-quality, safe products through 
ethically managed supply chains remains fundamental to the success of the Harvey Norman
® brand. As consumer expectations 
continue to evolve, suppliers are increasingly focused on sustainability-driven innovation—particularly in areas such as packaging reduction, supply-chain waste minimisation, product safety, and human rights protections.
Engagement with Suppliers on Product 
Sustainability / Safety
In FY25, global studies continued to highlight sustainability as a 
key consumer priority. The MM-Eye Say Do Sustainability Study  
identified trends such as transparency, circular packaging, and tech-enabled sustainability.
Relevant controlled entities observed these trends across its 
operations. In Australia and New Zealand, suppliers responded to Western Australia’s ban on moulded expanded polystyrene packaging by adopting alternative materials, with changes extending across all regions.
Relevant controlled entities in Slovenia and Croatia introduced 
Electrolux Ecoline models, which offer enhanced energy efficiency and incorporate recycled plastics. Electrolux estimates that 84% of an appliance’s climate impact occurs during use, making energy-efficient models critical to reducing Scope 3 emissions.
Relevant controlled entities in New Zealand operations reviewed 
their online fulfilment packaging strategy, transitioning from LDPE plastic to recyclable cardboard boxes for larger items. This aligns with practices already adopted by Australian franchisees.In Ireland, suppliers in the furniture and bedding categories shifted from polystyrene to recyclable packaging. The bedding category also updated trading terms to include ESG criteria, and suppliers are now contractually required to comply with the EU Timber Regulation.
Human Rights
The Company and each relevant controlled entity upholds its commitment to integrity and responsible conduct, as outlined in its Statement of Values.
A controlled entity manages a centralised program to ensure 
compliance with Australia’s Modern Slavery legislation. This framework enables each relevant controlled entity to conduct supplier due diligence independently.
Certain controlled entities are required to report publicly under 
Modern Slavery legislation.  Each of these controlled entities complies with their obligations under that legislation. Controlled entities with certain higher-risk product categories, are required to request suppliers to participate in a dedicated reporting program, including annual audits to verify human rights compliance.Solar installation program - Australia
Ten solar arrays were installed across four sites in FY25, taking the total number of solar arrays installed in Australia to more than eighty. Total kilowatt hour production of these arrays surpassed 8.2 Million kilowatt hours for the financial year, representing 6.4% of total electricity usage in complex sites, an increase in production of 12% over the FY24 production number and a reduction in location based emissions of 5,589 tonnes of Co2e. Electric Vehicles
In FY25, a relevant controlled entity commenced a program  
of adding electric and/or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles to the fleet and will monitor the effectiveness of these vehicles.
