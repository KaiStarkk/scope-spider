(1)'Effectively zero' refers to the fact that NAB may still hold some exposures to thermal coal in 2030, only through residual p erformance guarantees to rehabilitate existing coal 
mining assets. These guarantees are excluded from the financed emissions coverage of NAB's thermal coal sector target. For th e purposes of NAB’s ESG -related settings, 
thermal coal exposure means direct exposure to customers and projects whose primary activity is thermal coal mining, based up on the recorded 1993 ANZSIC codes on a net 
EAD basis. EAD for these ESG -related settings include lending, derivatives, financial guarantees and performance guarantees for the rehabilitation of existing assets. It excludes 
metallurgical coal mining, diversified mining customers and transactional banking (including deposit services) that do not gi ve rise to EAD and similar ancillary products and 
services. NAB’s NZBA -aligned thermal coal sector decarbonisation target includes diversified mining customers with revenue >5% f rom direct sale of thermal coal and excludes 
metallurgical coal mining customers (who are included in the NZBA -aligned iron and steel decarbonisation target). For completene ss, these NZBA EAD targets exclude 
transactional banking (including deposit services), risk management products and similar ancillary products and services. The se products and services are not in scope of 
accepted approaches for net -zero aligned target setting.Based on NAB’s financial reporting year. Reducing
