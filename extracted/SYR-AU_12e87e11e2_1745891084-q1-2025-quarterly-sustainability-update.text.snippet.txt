Balama Emissions and Air Quality
Greenhouse gas emissions and air quality monitored closely
(1) Refer to our Sustainability Policy: LINK  
(2) Emissions Intensity Rate = t CO2-e per tonne of natural graphite production. The BGO’s Emissions Intensity Rate is expected to decrease at higher production l evels.
(3) There are no Scope 2 emissions at Balama as there is no use of purchased electricity, steam, heat or cooling.Q1 2025 QUARTERLY SUSTAINABILITY UPDATE

and IFC Standards . The program  includes  actions  to monitor  and reduce  emissions  and closely  monitor  the air quality  in surrounding  communities . 
We are therefore  committed  to identifying,  measuring  and reducing  greenhouse  gas emissions  from our operations . To this effect,  we commissioned  an independent  Life Cycle  Assessment  ("LCA")  of 
our integrated  operations,  from Balama  origin  to Vidalia  customer  gate to quantify  the Global  Warming  Potential  (“GWP”)  of our products  (see next slide) . Syrah  is targeting  a reduction  in total 
greenhouse  gas emissions  (“GHG”)  generated  at Balama  by ~30%(1).

Life Cycle Assessment
Life cycle assessment of Syrah’s operations confirms a strong position relative to other suppliers of natural graphite and ac tive 
anode materials
Life Cycle  Assessment
▪An independent  life cycle  assessment  ("LCA")  of Syrah's  integrated  operations,  from Balama  origin  to Vidalia  
customer  gate,  has been  completed  by Minviro  Ltd(1). LCA is a globally  recognised  and scientifically  validated  
methodology  to quantify  direct  and embodied  environmental  impacts  along  the life cycle  of a product  or 
process .
▪The Global  Warming  Potential  (“GWP”)  of producing  natural  graphite  from Balama  and transporting  it to 
Nacala  port is estimated  to be 0.42kg CO2 equivalent  per 1kg natural  graphite . The GWP  of producing  Active  
Anode  Material  (“AAM”)  from Vidalia,  using  natural  graphite  from Balama,  is estimated  to be 7.3kg CO2 
equivalent  per 1kg AAM,  including  the impact  of producing  natural  graphite  at Balama  and transporting  it from 
Balama  gate to Vidalia  gate.
▪The GWP  of Balama  natural  graphite  is ~60% lower  than equivalent  natural  graphite  produced  from a 
benchmarked  supply  route  in Heilongjiang  Province,  China .
▪The GWP  of Vidalia  AAM  is ~50% lower  than natural  graphite  AAM  produced  from a benchmarked  supply  
route  in Heilongjiang  Province,  China  and is ~70% lower  than synthetic  graphite  AAM  produced  from a 
benchmarked  supply  route  in Inner  Mongolia  Province,  China .
▪The Company  continues  to engage  with the Louisiana  Electrical  Power  Authority  to understand  the pathway  
towards  increased  renewable  content  in site-supplied  power  to further  reduce  Vidalia’s  GWP .7.3

(1) Source : Minviro  Ltd's  life cycle  assessment  on Syrah  dated  August  2022 . Note : Global  Warming  Potential  (“GWP”)  is defined  as the cumulative  radiative  forcing,  both direct  and indirect  effects,  over a specified  time horizon  resulting  from the 
emission  of a unit mass  of gas related  to some  reference  gas [CO2: (IPCC  1996 )]. GWPs  shown  are a forecast  life of operation  average  for Vidalia  based  on detailed  engineering  and include  scope  1, scope  2 and scope  3 greenhouse  gas 
emissions . Syrah’s  LCA meets  the requirements  of ISO14040 /14044  standards  and has been  critically  reviewed  by an independent  third-party .Q4 2024 QUARTERLY SUSTAINABILITY UPDATE

Balama Solar and Battery Hybrid System
Solar and Battery Hybrid System reduces GHG emissions at BalamaQ1 2025 QUARTERLY SUSTAINABILITY UPDATE
Balama solar photovoltaic systemBalama’s  Solar  and Battery  Hybrid  System  remains  central  to advancing  
Syrah’s  ESG  strategy
▪Syrah  has constructed  and commissioned  a solar  PV power  system  (“Solar  and Battery  Hybrid  
System”)  at Balama  consisting of an 11.25 MWp  solar  PV installation  combined  with an 8.5 
MW/MWh  battery  energy  storage  system  (“BESS”)  to integrate  with the existing  diesel  power  
generation  plant .
▪The entire  PV array,  incorporating  20,832 solar  modules  covering  ~53,800sqm (~5.4 hectares),  
is fully integrated  to the BESS . 
▪The system  takes  advantage  of the high solar  irradiation  potential  of the site, and power  from the 
PV and BESS  system  can displace  ~30-35% of average  total diesel  consumption  at Balama  per 
annum .
▪The Solar  and Battery  Hybrid  System  will reduce  the Global  Warming  Potential  (“GWP”)  of 
Syrah’s  natural  graphite  products,  and it is estimated  that it will reduce  Balama’s  GWP  by an 
average  of 18kt CO2 equivalent  per annum  throughout  the operation’s  lifespan .
