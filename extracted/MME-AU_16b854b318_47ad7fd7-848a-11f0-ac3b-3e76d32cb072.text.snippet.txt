2 FY24 Actual and FY25 Ambition figures have been restated to reflect MONEYME’s updated financed emissions methodology that was introduced in FY25. 
Details of the methodology change are available in Appendix 4.

monitoring capabilities.Enhancing Employee Engagement
MONEYME’s overall staff engagement score remained at 
81% in FY25, outperforming relevant benchmarks such as 
72% for Finance Australia and 73% for Finance APAC.5 These 
survey results include labour hire staff based in the Philippines, 
demonstrating the Group’s approach to creating a positive 
workplace culture for all its staff.
Enabling Financial Literacy
More than 133,000 users have accessed MONEYME’s Credit 
Score tool as at 30 June 2025. In FY25, more than 29,000 
people read MONEYME’s Money Matters newsletter on 
average each month, which provides content and resources to 
help improve financial wellbeing.Supporting Customers in Hardship
MONEYME continued to monitor its hardship customer 
experience survey to capture and address customer feedback. 
The results show that 91.3% of respondents considered the 
hardship application process easy to understand and follow.

15 The analysis was conducted using Autopay asset-level data as at 31 December 2024. Underlying climate scenario data, results, and mapping are provided 
by S&P Global. Copyright © 2025, S&P Global Commodity Insights.
16 Scenario details are available at:  https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_WGI_SPM.pdfClimate Strategy
MONEYME’s climate strategy focuses on proactively identifying, assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities 
to enhance resilience and ensure long-term value creation. In line with the recommendations of the TCFD and ASRS, MONEYME 
undertook its first physical climate scenario analysis in FY25. The Group utilised a third-party software to conduct the analysis, 
which focused on the Group’s primary financed asset class of motor vehicles within its secured Autopay portfolio.15
Climate Scenario Analysis
The analysis applied two internationally recognised pathways developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 
(IPCC), known as Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs):16
SSP1-2.6 (Low Emissions) SSP5-8.5 (High Emissions)
Description Sustainability-focused pathway assuming 
rapid decarbonisation and low fossil fuel useFossil-fuel-intensive pathway assuming worst case emissions 
scenario
Projected Global 
Warming by 2100~ 1.8°C ~ 4.4°C
Policy ReactionStrong global cooperation and strengthened 
mitigation policies implemented quicklyNo new climate policies introduced beyond those already in 
place
Technology ChangeRapid emissions reduction across all sectors; 
transition supported by mitigation strategies Fossil fuel dominance persists; technological change 
reinforces high emissions with minimal low-carbon transition
These scenarios were selected to explore a range of plausible climate futures and to assess exposure to each risk type under its 
most extreme conditions. Transition risks refer to those arising from rapid policy or market changes, while physical risks relate to 
climate impacts such as extreme weather events.
The analysis covered the short-term (2020–2029) and medium-term (2030–2039) horizons, aligning with the typical loan 
lifespan in the Group’s loan book. Due to the limited business relevance of the long-term timeframe (2040–2050), this period 
was excluded.
Below is a list of the climate-related risks assessed:
Physical Hazards:
• Pluvial Flooding: Flooding due to extreme rainfall, potentially damaging vehicles.
• Fluvial Flooding: Overflow of rivers, affecting assets in floodplain regions.
• Coastal Flooding: Sea level rise and storm surge risks for vehicles in coastal areas.
• Tropical Cyclones: High-wind and rain events, particularly impacting assets in areas such as northern Australia.
• Wildfire: Exposure to bushfires that may affect borrower communities and asset recovery.
• Landslide: Triggered by heavy rain in elevated terrain, with limited and localised impacts on vehicles.
Transition Risk:
• Carbon Pricing: Regulatory mechanisms like carbon taxes or emissions trading schemes that may affect borrower operating 
costs and indirectly influence loan repayment capacity.

The projected frequency of each physical climate hazard varies across different regions of Australia. The map below projects the 
most frequently occurring hazard type, above a defined severity threshold, in each area for the 2030s under a High Emissions 
scenario. This is a national-level view and is not linked to any specific assets.
MONEYME’s scenario analysis utilised the 
physical location of financed vehicles across 
Australia. This data was compared to regional 
hazard patterns to complete an assessment 
of the Group’s climate risk exposure for the 
assets included in the analysis. The geographic 
distribution of MONEYME’s secured vehicle 
assets is summarised in the chart to the right:
Illustrative relative physical risk exposure to MONEYME’s underlying collateral:

The illustrative relative risk exposures show the estimated annual exposure to each hazard compared with other hazards. Overall 
hazard exposure is considered immaterial relative to the loan book value, and these climate-related risks are not expected to 
result in direct material losses for MONEYME.
