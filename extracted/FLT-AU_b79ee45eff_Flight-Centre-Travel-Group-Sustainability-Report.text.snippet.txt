• We have moved to 94% renewable electricity in the UK and in FY24 are putti ng a  plan in  
place to transition Australia to renewable electricity as contracts come up for renewal.
Carbon offset investment • Our ongoing sustainability partnership with Trees4Travel and their Trees4Ev ents tool has 
allowed us to make climate contributions for some of the carbon emissions associated with our 2022 and 2023 global gathering. By the end of FY23, we
 had funded the planting of almost 
65,000 trees in Jodhipur as part of the  Nepal reforestation project.
Influencing sustainable  
behaviour across our value chain• Through our global gathering 2023, we were able to build a Community Hub i n the village  
of Manggis within the Kaura Bali immersive retreat. Refer to page 57.“As one of the world’s largest 
travel companies, we recognise 
our responsibility to preserve the

Our journey to net zero
While the global transition towards a net zero future is a signiﬁcant challenge for the travel  
and tourism industry, we are focused on being part of the solution. With tourism accounting for 
eight percent of annual global carbon emissions, of which approximately two percent comes from air
 travel11, we understand the importance of making lower carbon travel a reality. We’re committed  
to collaborating with the broader industry to identify solutions that will help make this possible  
while taking steps to address our own carbon footprint. 
Our approach
Our goal is to reach net zero by 2050. To work towards this, we are taking a multi-pronged approach that is built on 
the ongoing measurement of our carbon footprint, engaging with our partners and supporting our customers to make lower-impact travel decisions. Our strategy is anchored in the prioritisation of reducing our emissions, supplemented by the utilisation of verified carbon offset programs in scenarios where immediate reduction is
 not feasible or is delayed.
The attainment of net zero involves the active implementation of methods to reduce emissions by 90% from a set baseline (outlined in the Science based target initiative (SBTi) methodology). In contrast, carbon neutrality can be achieved through carbon offsets. As
 our ultimate objective is carbon reduction, we have chosen not to participate in 
a carbon neutral certification program, nor do we intend to offset 100% of our emissions. Our  focus remains firmly on 
reducing our carbon footprint.
Being a long-term goal, our 2050 net zero target considers a grid-wide and sector-wide decarbonisation pathway based 
on current rates. In alignment with the International Air Transport Association (IATA) and their commitment to “Fly Net Zero by 2050”, this commitment requires that our suppliers meet their emission reduction obligations over this time period.
In 2022, we completed our first emissions footprint (scope 1, 2 and 3), choosing FY19 as the baseline year. FY19 provided 
the most appropriate and complete dataset based on usual operating levels, as opposed to FY20 and FY21 which were irregular due to COVID-19. In FY23, we updated our footprint again to help us better understand our impact and identify how our footprint has changed over time.
Using our FY19 baseline, we engaged external consultancy firm, Edge Impact, to help us update our footprint and set 
targets aligned to science
12, being:
• Reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions 46.2% by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050 from a 2019 base year.
• Reduce absolute scope 313 GHG emissions 27.5% by 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050 from a 2019 base year.
Through this process, we have developed a decarbonisation pathway that sets out key milestones for our journey to reach net zero by 2050. We acknowledge that this is a large undertaking and, to set ourselves up for success, we are working to ensure we have the right policy and framework in place and we are developing tools and systems to improve our
 emissions reporting.
Alongside our decarbonisation journey, we are continuing to build our understanding  of climate-related risks and 
opportunities across the business. Please  see the our principles section of this report to understand how FLT manages 
climate-related financial disclosure and plans to respond to the draft reporting standards defined by both the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) and the Australian
 Accounting Standards Board (AASB).

Our commitment to science-based targets 
In December 2022, FLT submitted our emissions reduction targets for validation by the Science Based Targets initiative 
(SBTi). We did this to ensure transparency across our net zero strategy and provide additional rigour to our approach. Unfortunately, the SBTi did not approve these targets because initially, we excluded category 11 from our submitted targets based on the previous SBTi methodology. However, the SBTi updated their methodology in late 2023,  making category 11 a mandatory inclusion for the entire travel sector. As of now, FLT’s commitment to the SBTi  has been temporarily removed from their website while we work on finding a solution.
Category 11 poses a significant challenge for the travel industry as a whole. For FLT, most emissions in this  
category stem
 from airfares sold through our various brands. Setting realistic reduction targets is difficult  
due to our limited control over our partners’ operations and the lack of alternative, lower-carbon airline fuel.  Consequently, an industry-wide approach is necessary. FLT is actively in discussions with other travel  organisations and our UK trade body, ABTA – the
 Travel Association, to find a solution.2020

Carbon Offset 
StrategyOur net zero plan involves offsetting part of our business travel program fro m 2020 onwards including flights and 
accommodation and then the scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operations from 2026 onwards.
The offsetting projects are being developed and will cover a diverse portfolio with a focus on nature-based projects. 
Our strategy is anchored in the prioritisation of reducing our emissions, sup plemented by the utilisation of verified carbon 
offset programs in scenarios where immediate reduction is not feasible. Carbon offsetting is only an interim measure; our
 overall goal is carbon reduction.
GHG Emissions Exclusionscategory 4 – upstream transport and distribution of sold products (immaterial);
category 8 – upstream leased assets (included within our scope 2);category 9 – transport and distribution of sold products (immaterial);category 10 – processing of sold products (immaterial);category 11 - 
 this category is not included in our reduction target, refer to re asons below. We will still include strategies  
for our customers to reduce the emissions from travel we sell; 
category 12 – end of life treatment of sold products (immaterial); andcategory 13 – downstream leased assets (included within our scope 2).
Assumptions Assumptions were made to calculate our carbon footprint from FY19 where  clear data was not available. 
The
 environmental management system being created will alleviate the need for some assumptions within  
our footprint  from FY26 onwards.
Dependencies Being a long term goal, our 2050 net zero target considers a grid-wide and sector-wide decarbonisation pathway  
based on current rates. Our 2050 commitment requires our suppliers meet their own emissions reduction obligations  over this time period.
