"supplier’s emissions reduction target is science-based. This guidance defines the key criteria that includes, but is not limited to: a) target boundary (coverage of scopes, emission types and subsidiaries), b) target coverage (≥95% of scope 1 and 2 emissions, ≥67% near-",
"term Scope 3 and ≥90% long-term Scope 3), c) target type (absolute, intensity, or engagement), d) base year (≥2015), e) target year (near-term maximum 10 years and long-term maximum 2050), f) target reduction/ambition (Scope 1 and 2 1.5°C, Scope 3 near-term well",

7. The Supplier Engagement Target originally set in FY24 was ‘75% of suppliers, by spend, covering purchased goods and services, and upstream transportation and distribution, will have science-based emissions reduction targets by",
"the end of FY27’. During SBTi’s recent validation of our FY30 FLAG target, Coles was required to separate FLAG sector emissions from the SET boundary and include additional emissions categories in target spend coverage to meet the SBTi target boundary requirements.",
"As a result, our target has been modified from 75% to 80% and the target date extended from the end of FY27 to the end of FY29. Reporting against the updated target boundary will commence in FY26. For more information see page 17.  —

9. FY25 Scope 1 emissions and",
Scope 2 emissions include one month of estimated data (based on meter data or weighted averages of actuals) and 11 months of actual data and is calculated on a Scope 2 market-based methodology using LGCs. Coles has not relied on the use of carbon offsets for the,
achievement of our Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction.,
