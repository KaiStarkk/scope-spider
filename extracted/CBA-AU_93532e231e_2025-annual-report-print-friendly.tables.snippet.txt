Power generation
The power generation sector includes the generation of electricity. These are our customers who generate significant revenue
from electricity generation. This includes customers with more than 5% of revenue from thermal coal electricity generation.
"Customers with less than $1 million of exposures are generally excluded. For power generation, the alignment metric is"
"kgCO2/MWh, an intensity metric reflects the critical role of power generation in the economy. Where data is not available,"
emissions are estimated using the customer’s reported generation and grid specific physical emissions intensity factors from
"the relevant regional body, for example National Greenhouse Accounts for Australia or equivalent source outside of Australia."
Zero Scope 1 emissions are assumed for renewable customers unless customer reported emissions are available.
"We track the portfolio emissions intensity against the IEA NZE (2021) however, we calculate the power generation target"
"against the IEA SDS for OECD nations, based on total electricity and heat sectors CO2 emissions divided by total electricity"
generation. Our 2030 target of 105 kgCO2/MWh is 33% below the equivalent figure in the global IEA NZE (2021) scenario.
We originally tracked towards this value based on the IEA SDS for OECD nations and chose to retain it as our 2030 target
as it represents a lower emissions intensity than the IEA NZE (2021) transition pathway in 2030.
Transport – Australian road (passenger and light commercial vehicle finance)
The Australian road (passenger and light commercial vehicle) sector includes lending for the finance of passenger vehicles
"and light commercial vehicles. 1 Passenger vehicles include both cars and motorcycles. We have chosen a combined goal,"
recognising that many light commercial vehicles are used primarily as passenger vehicles and the decarbonisation profile is
expected to be similar across these vehicle types.
The goal metric is an intensity metric (gCO2/vehicle km) calculated by dividing the attributed Scope 1 emissions (gCO2) from
motor vehicle finance (as described on page 397) by attributed distance travelled (vehicle km). Distance travelled currently
reflects average distance travelled by vehicle type based on data published by BITRE. Attributed distance travelled reflects
"distance travelled multiplied by the attribution factor, where the attribution factor is the outstanding loan amount divided by"
"the value of the security at origination. Where valuation data is unavailable, 100% attribution is assumed."
"Our sector-level financed emissions goal for road transport is a Scope 1 intensity goal, to align to the scope of the reference"
"scenario. However, we include Scope 2 absolute emissions for this sector within our financed emissions disclosure."
"The selected reference scenario is the IPR RPS (2021), which models a 34% reduction in annual emissions per ‘car’ between"
2020 and 2030. This emissions intensity reduction is applied to the 2020 Australian national average emissions intensity
(262 gCO2/vehicle km) for passenger vehicles (motorcycles and cars) and light commercial vehicles which has been calculated
using data published by BITRE. 2
Transport – Aviation
"The aviation sector includes customers that are commercial airline operators that offer scheduled services, and aircraft"
"lessors to such operators. 3 Where CBA had less than $5 million of TCE to a customer at the reporting date, the customer"
was excluded from the scope of the goal in order to focus data collection efforts on more material exposures.
For aviation the goal metric is an intensity metric (gCO2/revenue passenger km) calculated by dividing attributed
"‘tank-to-wake’ emissions 4 (Scope 1 for operators and Scope 33 for lessors), in gCO2, by attributed revenue passenger"
kilometres (RPK). This reflects the continued role of aviation in a decarbonising world. We source emissions and RPK data
"from airline sustainability reporting for exposures to airlines or lessors where the lessee is known. Where data is not available,"
"including for lessors where the lessees are unknown, emissions intensity is estimated using the portfolio average. Where CO2"
"data is unavailable, we use CO2-e."
"However, we include Scope 2 (Scope 3 ‘indirect electricity’ for lessors) absolute emissions for this sector, which are generally"
"minimal, within our financed emissions disclosure."
"Attribution follows the PCAF business lending methodology. For lessors where the lessee is known, the attribution factor"
denominator is the total equity and debt or EVIC of the lessee and the attribution factor numerator is drawn lending exposure
"to the lessee. As lending in our aviation portfolio generally relates to specific aircraft within an airline’s fleet, we may seek"
to improve the accuracy of our financed emissions estimates for this sector over time by substituting airline level data with
aircraft specific data and adapting our attribution approach accordingly.
We track the portfolio emissions intensity against the IEA NZE (2021) global pathway for aviation. A global reference scenario
is appropriate given the global nature of our portfolio.

=== Table 50 (page 406) ===
Heavy industry – Cement
"The cement sector includes manufacturing portland, natural and other hydraulic cement from crushed limestone and clay or"
"shale. For cement, the alignment metric is tCO2-e/tonne cement production. An intensity metric reflects the role of cement"
"production in buildings and construction. We define cement as cementitious product, which aligns with the GHG Protocol’s"
‘specific CO2 per ton of cementitious product’ definition. This means that our sector-level financed emissions goal for cement
is a Scope 1 and Scope 2 intensity goal. This aligns with the boundary of the reference scenario used for the goal. Emissions
and production associated with imported clinker and clinker purchased from third parties (typically reported as Scope 3)
"are not included in the goal. However, we include Scope 3 absolute emissions for cement sector customers within the heavy"
industry sector presented in our financed emissions disclosure.
"The selected reference scenario is from the SBTi Cement target-setting tool (Version 2.1.2), using an emissions intensity"
"of 0.708 tCO2-e Scope 1 emissions/tonnes of cement, for the base year of 2021, sourced from the Department of Climate"
"Change, Energy, the Environment and Water (DCCEEW). 1 While this baseline and resulting sector-level pathway only accounts"
"for Scope 1 emissions, we adopt a conservative approach by comparing it against our annual intensity metric which is inclusive"
of both Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions.
Upstream oil and gas extraction
Upstream oil extraction refers to entities whose principal operations include the exploration and development of oil fields for
the purposes of extracting and producing crude oil. This does not include midstream or downstream activities. Upstream
"gas extraction refers to entities whose principal operations include exploration, ownership, development and management"
"of gas fields, that are used for the purpose of natural gas production. For upstream oil and gas extraction the target metric"
"is absolute emissions. Where a customer reports emissions, we assign emissions to upstream oil and gas extraction using a"
"‘pro-rata’ share based on the customer’s production of oil and gas and the emissions factor for each activity, respectively,"
"expressed in ‘million barrels of oil equivalent’. Where customer-level emissions data is not available, the customer’s reported"
production data is multiplied by an activity emissions intensity factor 2 to estimate Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Scope 3
"emissions are estimated by first converting production, in barrels of oil equivalent, to energy content using an energy content"
factor from third-party sources such as Energy Institute’s Statistical Review of World Energy and then multiplying the energy
content by emissions factors from the National Greenhouse Accounts.
We calculate our upstream oil and gas extraction targets using the percentage decrease of emissions from combustion
"activities, oil and natural gas respectively between 2020 and 2030 from the IEA NZE (2021) scenario."
Thermal coal mining
The thermal coal mining sector includes companies that mine thermal coal. We include all thermal coal mining customers with
more than 5% of their revenue coming directly from the sale of thermal coal in our 2030 target. For thermal coal mining the
"target metric is absolute emissions. Where customer-level emissions data is not available, the customer’s reported production"
data is multiplied by a physical emissions intensity factor 2 to estimate Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Scope 3 emissions are
estimated by multiplying production by National Greenhouse Accounts energy content and emissions factors for bituminous
"coal. Where a customer reports coal emissions, we assign emissions to thermal coal mining using a ‘pro-rata’ share based"
on the customer’s production of thermal coal as a proportion of total coal: coal emissions x (thermal coal production/total
coal production).
We calculate our thermal coal mining target using the percentage decrease of emissions from coal combustion activities
between 2020 and 2030 from the IEA NZE (2021) scenario. Our E&S Framework details our commitments regarding thermal
"coal mining financing. We have set a 2030 interim target for thermal coal mining, to reduce our financed emissions in thermal"
coal mining by 100% from our 2020 baseline. This represents a faster reduction than the IEA NZE (2021) scenario.

Guidance on forward-looking statements
"This report contains certain forward-looking statements with respect to the financial condition, capital adequacy, operations"
and business of the Group and certain plans and objectives of the management of the Group. Such forward-looking
statements speak only as at the date of this report and undue reliance should not be placed upon such statements. Although

"Forward-looking statements can generally be identified by the use of forward-looking words such as “may”, “will”, “would”,"
"“could”, “expect”, “intend”, “plan”, “aim”, “estimate”, “target”, “anticipate”, “believe”, “continue”, “objectives”, “outlook”,"
