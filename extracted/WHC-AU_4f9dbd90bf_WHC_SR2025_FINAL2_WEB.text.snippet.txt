Overview 4
We supply metallurgical coal for blast furnace 
steelmaking, helping to support global renewable energy 
infrastructure, economic development, and energy 
security. We also produce among the highest quality 
seaborne thermal coal, which delivers superior efficiency 
and lower emissions intensity than lower-quality coals in 
like-for-like power stations.
As a responsible operator, we are committed to balancing 
the critical role of coal with the need for emissions 
reduction efforts. We continue to set a Scope 1 greenhouse 
gas emissions intensity reduction target aligned with our 
obligations under the reformed Safeguard Mechanism 
scheme, which supports Australia’s national climate targets 
and aligns with the goals of the Paris Agreement. This target 
seeks to reduce the Scope 1 emissions intensity of our 
Blackwater, Daunia, Narrabri and Maules Creek mines. 
At the Maules Creek Mine, we recently completed a trial 
of renewable diesel and we will continue to work with fuel 
suppliers to assess the availability and affordability of 
alternative fuels. 
There has been increasing investment in carbon capture, 
utilisation and storage (CCUS) technology in China, 
with the development of three major projects by China 
Energy and China Huaneng. CCUS is recognised by the 
International Energy Agency as a key technology to achieve 
Net Zero. Through our association with Low Emission 
Technology Australia or LETA, we advocate and provide 
funding for greater investment in emissions abatement 
technologies, including carbon capture and storage. 
We are also taking sensible steps to reduce our Scope 2 
emissions footprint. Through the purchase of Climate 
Active certified carbon-neutral electricity 100% of our 
Scope 2 emissions in New South Wales are considered 
zero emissions. 
We also progressed the development of our solar farm at 
the Narrabri Mine, which is our most electricity-intensive 
asset in New South Wales, with the submission of our 
Environmental Impact Statement during the reporting 
period. The solar farm offers prospects to generate 
carbon free electricity for this asset. While we continue to explore the prospect of various 
decarbonisation initiatives, we expect to rely on carbon 
credits to meet our Safeguard Mechanism obligations 
in the near term, as many site-based projects are not 
yet technically or commercially feasible due to slow 
technological progress.
FY25 operational performance highlights
FY25 represents our first full year of ownership of the 
Blackwater and Daunia mines. This is reflected in our  
run-of-mine (ROM) managed production of 39.1Mt, 
which is up from 24.5Mt in FY24. In parallel, our 
New South Wales operations performed well overall. 
We are managing well through the current softer coal 
price environment. Our focus on cost management 
is reflected in our A$139/t cost of coal for FY25, 
which was better than our cost guidance of A$140 
to $155/t cost for the year.
The increased scale and diversification provided by 
our Queensland mines helps de-risk our business and 
positions us to deliver sustained value for our customers, 
communities, investors and other stakeholders. 
People
We want our people to go above and beyond to drive 
excellence in safe operations, environmental performance 
and project delivery. 
We know our people are our most important asset and 
their safety is our top priority. We believe everyone should 
expect to go home safely every day. 
This philosophy is reflected in the long-term improvement 
in safety performance across our expanded business. 
We recorded an employee and contractor total recordable 
injury frequency rate (TRIFR) of 4.6, which is below the 
five-year average of 5.1 for the consolidated Queensland 
and New South Wales operations since 2021, and as 
always we remain focused on improvement of our safety 
practices as we strive for even stronger outcomes.Managing Director and CEO’s message continued
We recognise that an engaged and high-performing 
workforce is essential for the success and growth of 
our business. Feedback from our workforce highlighted 
our strong sense of teamwork and the pride and purpose 
our people feel as coal miners contributing to both their 
local communities and the global economy. 
We believe in providing equal opportunities for everyone 
and we are committed to a culture where opportunities 
are earned. Alongside this focus, our goal has been 
to grow female representation. This year, female 
representation across all our operations was 21.7% 
and women held 24.1% of leadership roles. 
We also continue to see a high level of employees 
identifying as Indigenous Australians, with 10.4% across 
the business, and higher proportions at Maules Creek 
and Vickery.

About our reporting 
Scope and boundary 
The scope of this report is defined by the sustainability 
issues we have identified as material topics, which are 
detailed on page 10. 
We adopt an operational control approach to reporting 
sustainability data, accounting for 100% of joint ventures 
where we have operational control, irrespective of our 
equity interest, except where otherwise noted. 
Following the acquisition of the Blackwater and Daunia 
mines on 2 April 2024, we have fully consolidated data 
from these operations in our FY25 report. 
In FY24, only selected metrics incorporated our 
Queensland mines, namely emissions and energy data, 
environmental enforceable actions, tailings storage 
facilities and selected people data. 
Independent assurance 
We engaged Ernst & Young (EY) to provide independent 
limited assurance of selected FY25 emissions and energy 
data, safety metrics and Indigenous spend. The scope 
and limitations of EY’s unqualified assurance are 
outlined in its report on pages 67-68.Reporting standards
Our Sustainability Report 2025 continues to be informed 
by the recommendations of the Financial Stability Board’s 
Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 
(TCFD) and the Sustainability Accounting Standards 
Board (SASB) Coal Operations Standard. An SASB Coal 
Standard Index, which indicates where each topic has 
been referenced in our disclosures, is included in our 
Sustainability Databook on our website.
Sustainability reporting suite
In addition to this FY25 Sustainability Report,  
we publish on our website:
• a Sustainability Databook with up to five years of 
historic data, and the SASB Coal Standard Index
• our annual Modern Slavery Statement, with our FY25 
statement to be published in late 2025
• our annual Workplace Gender Equality Agency report.
Looking forward
Whitehaven is preparing for the implementation of 
Australian Accounting Standard Board (AASB) S2  
Climate-related disclosures, with cross-functional teams 
focused on the key areas of climate-related governance, 
strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. 
Given the evolution of our approach to sustainability 
reporting over the past five years, Whitehaven is well 
placed to adopt these new Australian standards.
The new standards will apply to Whitehaven from FY26 
and require Scope 3 emissions reporting from FY27. 
We continue to work with external consultants to map 
our most material Scope 3 emissions, to help us fully 
prepare to report under AASB.

Strategy
Our climate strategy is focused on 
supporting economic development and 
energy security in our customer countries, 
predominantly in Asia, while also helping 
to meet decarbonisation goals.
Metallurgical coal plays a vital role in underpinning 
infrastructure growth and economic development 
globally. It remains a critical and non-substitutable 
component of blast furnace steelmaking. 
Our high-quality thermal coal has a key role to play in 
supporting global energy security during the energy 
transition, particularly in Asia where demand remains 
strong for its use in high-efficiency, lower-emissions, 
coal- fired power stations.
In FY25, we made significant progress toward our 
strategic goal of increasing our exposure to metallurgical 
coal with the acquisition of the Daunia and Blackwater 
mines from BMA in April 2024. As a result, our portfolio 
is now weighted toward metallurgical coal accounting for 
64% of revenue in FY25, while thermal coal contributed 
the balance of 36%.
Role of metallurgical coal 
Steel is the world’s most important engineering and 
construction material and is used in thousands of 
different applications in daily life. It is crucial for modern 
manufacturing and infrastructure development, including 
the development of infrastructure needed for the 
energy transition. 
It is estimated around 250 tonnes of metallurgical coal 
is required to build a single onshore wind turbine and the 
recently announced Medog Hydropower Station in China 
will require approximately 2.4 million tonnes of steel to 
construct, which implies a requirement for nearly 2 million 
tonnes of metallurgical coal.Climate change position
Whitehaven aims to play a practical and positive role in the shift 
to a lower-carbon future. We do this by producing metallurgical 
coal, which is a key input to manufacture steel for renewable 
energy infrastructure; supporting global energy security and 
our customers’ decarbonisation goals through the provision of 
thermal coal for use in high-efficiency, lower-emissions coal-
fired power stations; and investing in technologies and initiatives 
that can—or have the potential to—progressively decarbonise 
our operations. 
We support the aims of the Paris Agreement and recognise 
the importance of its ambition to hold the increase in the global 
average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels. 
At the same time, we believe the transition to a lower-carbon 
future will take decades, not years, and that decarbonisation 
must be considered alongside the need to support economic 
growth while providing secure, reliable and affordable energy 
to underpin standards of living. 
We acknowledge Australia’s commitment to net-zero carbon 
emissions by 2050 and continue to align our decarbonisation 
ambition and business practices with the emissions reduction 
obligations set by the Australian Government, which support 
our national climate targets and align with the goals of the 
Paris Agreement. 
We note that net-zero emissions should not be confused with 
zero emissions and that, given the world’s growing energy and 
development needs and its continuing dependence on fossil fuels, 
greater pragmatism is required around better managing carbon as a 
by-product of energy and industrial processes through technology, 
including carbon capture and storage. 
Our FY30 Scope 1 emissions intensity reduction target aligns with 
our obligations under the reformed Safeguard Mechanism which 
commenced on 1 July 2023 (see page 31).
