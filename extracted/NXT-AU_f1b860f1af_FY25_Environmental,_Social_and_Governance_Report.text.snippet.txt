Sustainable procurement and 
supply chains
NEXTDC’s supply chain spans building 
contractors, equipment 
manufacturers, utility providers, and 
technology and service partners. We 
manage these relationships through 
procurement practices that emphasise 
sustainability, compliance, and ethical 
conduct. While our direct influence 
may lessen further upstream, we 
promote responsible business 
practices through our Supplier Code of 
Conduct and ESG due diligence 
processes. These include modern 
slavery risk assessments, supplier 
self-assessments and targeted ESG 
questionnaires. Our approach is 
grounded in a risk-based methodology 
that helps identify and manage key 
environmental, social, and governance 
risks across the value chain, with an 
emphasis on transparency, 
accountability, and continuous 
improvement.
Design and innovation
Our design and engineering teams 
embed high-performance, scalable, 
and sustainable infrastructure 
principles from day one. This includes 
modular builds, advanced cooling 
systems, and automation-ready 
facilities in order to futureproof our 
operations. We also focus on climate 
risk resilience and energy efficiency at 
the design stage.
Site selection and design
NEXTDC’s value chain begins with 
identifying and securing sites that 
support our growth while minimising 
environmental and community 
impacts. Our site selection process 
integrates sustainability considerations 
such as energy security, water 
availability and biodiversity.
Customer success and digital 
access
NEXTDC supports a diverse 
customer base with a global 
footprint, focused on building 
long-term, collaborative 
relationships. Our customers rely on 
us for reliable, secure, and 
lower-carbon digital infrastructure. 
Through initiatives like NEXTNeutral 
and customised sustainability 
reporting, we enable them to 
progress their own ESG goals. 
We’re also helping expand access 
to secure, high-performance digital 
services that underpin modern 
digital economies.
Capital works and 
construction
We deliver high-quality 
digital infrastructure 
through disciplined 
capital works 
execution. This 
includes coordination 
with utility providers, 
regulators, and delivery 
partners to ensure 
on-time, on-budget 
builds while managing 
resource efficiency and 
embodied carbon 
outcomes.
Operations
Our data centres are optimised for 
uptime, energy efficiency, and security. 
Operations teams use digital 
monitoring, AI-powered analytics, and 
predictive maintenance to improve 
resource performance.
Emissions and circularity
We measure Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Waste from operations and 
construction is managed through recycling, reuse, and diversion from 
landfill. Circular design principles are applied to reduce the lifecycle impacts 
of our infrastructure.
People
At NEXTDC, we strive to be a leading employer by fostering a safe, 
inclusive, and high-performing workplace. Globally, our people help drive a 
culture of excellence and value creation. We are committed to protecting 
the physical, mental, and social wellbeing of our workforce. Through strong 
DE&I principles, comprehensive policies, and ongoing training, we nurture 
talent and provide meaningful pathways for growth and development.
Energy and water stewardship
NEXTDC is taking a more conscious approach 
to the resources and energy that support the 
delivery of our data centres. We are prioritising 
lower-carbon and embodied carbon materials in 
construction, with a preference for those that 
are locally sourced, supporting regional 
suppliers and reducing emissions associated 
with transport. We also recognise the 
importance of managing long-term energy risks 
and are progressively exploring opportunities to 
transition to lower-emission energy sources. 
This includes long-term sourcing of renewable 
energy, co-locating with low emissions energy 
sources, low-carbon alternate fuels, continuing 
to invest in on-site solar generation where 
feasible, and working closely with our partners 
to identify solutions that support more 
sustainable energy outcomes over time. 
We continue to maintain a strong focus on 
PUE and WUE. Water-based cooling is 
preferred for its efficiency, and we  
continue to fine-tune system  
performance to reduce impact.
Connectivity and partnerships
With over 750 partners in our 
ecosystem, we enable seamless 
cloud, network, and digital platform 
connectivity. Our partnerships with 
digital, energy, and technology 
providers help build more integrated, 
resilient infrastructure across 
Australia and the region.
Community engagement
We invest in local communities 
through volunteering, charity 
partnerships, and programs that 
support skills development and 
long-term resilience.
End-user value creation
Our operations create local 
economic value through 
employment, supply chain contracts 
and investment in digital 
infrastructure that provides a 
material services. We prioritise local 
supplier engagement and invest in 
community initiatives focused on 
STEM, inclusion, and digital 
empowerment.Upstream Downstream
