We see opportunities and potential to be part of the 
global energy shift, as the minerals and metals MMG 
produces are essential for sustainable technologies 
including solar and wind power, electric vehicles, 
energy storage and critical infrastructure. All of this 
will help contribute to a low carbon future. Minimising 
our environmental footprint is a key part of our goal 
to achieving net zero carbon emissions by 2050 for 
Scopes 1 and 2.
Our operations are committed to reducing their 
energy use and improving efficiency on site, with 
Khoemaca u and Las Bambas actively exploring options 
to develop renewable energy sources for operational 
requirements. Dugald River’s solar farm, which 
came online in 2023, has reduced energy-related 
emissions by over 30 per cent. We are also supporting 
governments in the regions in which we operate to 
review efficiency and stability of grid electricity, such 
as in the DRC, which faces stability challenges with its 
electricity grid that is primarily fed by renewable power. 
We are also constantly improving the quality of our 
emissions data, with a dedicated project in 2025 to 
work with our Supply Chain and Enterprise Technology 
teams on improving Scope 3 emissions data. This 
will give us more accurate data on our upstream and 
downstream emissions profiles and the ability to take 
strategic decisions as we work towards our 2050 goals. Energy and climate change action
We recognise the impacts and risks that climate change poses to our operations,  
our host communities and regions.
Case study:  
Rosebery invests  
in diesel-electric loaders
As we move towards a lower-carbon future,  
our operations need to adopt new technologies 
to meet our climate commitments. Our Rosebery 
operation has invested in diesel-electric vehicles 
to reduce its carbon footprint. In the initial two-
month trial, the loaders reduced emissions, used 
56 per cent less fuel and generated 15 per cent 
less heat, which in turn reduced refrigeration 
requirements underground. They also considerably 
reduced the diesel particulate matter emissions 
underground, promoting safer workplace 
conditions for our people. This initiative not only 
addresses environmental concerns but also offers 
cost savings, showcasing a balanced approach to 
sustainability and operational efficiency.Downstream processing  2,031,640.60Total emissions
