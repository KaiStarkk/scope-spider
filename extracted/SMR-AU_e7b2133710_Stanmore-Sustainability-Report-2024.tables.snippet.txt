Our Decarbonisation Plan underpins future activities in the
"years to come through a phased approach. At Stanmore,"
we have prioritised abatement opportunities at specific
"facilities, including South Walker Creek and Poitrel. Fugitive"
emissions have been identified as a significant contributor
"to our overall Scope 1 emissions, accounting for 48% of our"
"Scope 1 emissions. As a result, we are focusing on reducing"
these emissions across our facilities. In the short to
"medium term, we have prioritised the reduction of fugitive"
emissions at our South Walker Creek facility through the
use of gas for the power station.

CASE STUDY
Dragline DC to AC Upgrade Project
"In July 2024, our Dragline 27 (DRE 27) at"
South Walker Creek walked off the pad having
completed its conversion from a direct current
system (DC) to an alternating current system
(AC). This conversion makes South Walker Creek
the first Australian coal mine to have a fully
converted fleet from aging DC rotating
equipment to new AC rotating and control.
"The conversion to AC equipment improves the safety,"
reliability and operational efficiency of the dragline.
The upgrade provided standardisation between the
two draglines onsite at SWC and allows reduced
maintenance and production improvements. The new
AC drives also offer better control over motor speed
and torque compared to traditional DC systems
resulting in less energy loss. This will reduce the
"overall energy consumed by DRE27, reducing"
associated Scope 2 emissions.
