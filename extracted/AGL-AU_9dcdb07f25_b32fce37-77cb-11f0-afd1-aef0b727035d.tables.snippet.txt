,Battery Rewards program enables customers to earn by exporting energy back to the grid during peak times.
,• Hot water orchestration: Electric hot water system orchestration presents a significant opportunity to help customers

,AGL customers can apply for a Plenti Green Loan to install a solar battery in their home at a discounted interest rate.
•,"Electric vehicles: We have made significant progress in the e-mobility space, with products and services that encourage"
,"customers to switch to EVs. Our EV plans attracted approximately 35,000 customers5 in FY25, with our offering including"
,"discounted tariffs for home charging, complemented by our public kerbside charging offer partnership with BP pulse, enabling"
,EV recharging away from home at a competitive cost. In FY25 we expanded our business offerings and capabilities through
,"the acquisition of Everty, a full-service electric vehicle charging and energy management software platform for commercial"

,customers to shift their energy usage while progressing toward vehicle-to-grid readiness.
•,"Climate Active certified products: AGL provided 551,6366 Climate Active certified Carbon Neutral services (up from 510,074"

FY26-30,70%
FY31-35,64%
FY26-35,67%
"To meet our 12 GW energy portfolio transition ambition, grid-scale renewables and firming is expected to be supplied to AGL from projects",
"developed and funded on AGL's balance sheet, utilising available debt capacity and operating cash flows, projects funded by third parties and",
backed with offtakes from AGL and projects funded by partnerships and backed with offtakes from AGL.,
"We expect grid-scale renewable generation to be mostly sourced via offtakes and partnerships, given the strong availability of capital for",
these assets and the fair allocation of risks between the project and the offtaker.,
Securing supply from renewable assets via offtakes allows AGL to optimise the deployment of our balance sheet capital. We estimate that,
"approximately $10 billion will be funded on our balance sheet across the course of AGL’s energy portfolio transition, with this investment",
heavily weighted towards firming assets. We expect to invest in a mix of short- and long-duration firming assets.,
"In the longer term, the bulk of our balance sheet investment is intended to be made in long-duration firming assets, with AGL expecting to",
invest across a range of project types.,
AGL will also continue to deploy capital to support our retail business and existing thermal assets. Future investment in our existing thermal,
"fleet will be important to deliver safety, flexibility, and availability until closure, recognising the critical role thermal generation plays in",
providing reliable and affordable electricity during the energy transition.,
7.2.4 Considering future costs of carbon,
"As one of our strategic pillars, we factor ESG considerations into the work we do and the decisions we make to safeguard our business,",
"access future opportunities, unlock strategic advantage and support long-term value creation. AGL’s enterprise-wide ESG decision-making",
framework is used to promote consistency in how ESG issues are considered during decision-making processes and encourage early,
"consideration of future emissions associated with new projects, products or acquisitions.",
The potential future cost of carbon offsets is taken into consideration as part of our financial planning and capital approvals. We consider a,
"range of carbon cost forecasts in our capital allocation decision-making, including to inform carbon investment and origination investment",
,"decisions, as well as our net zero target cost forecasting. The carbon price used in estimating the costs of offsets to meet our target to be net"
zero for Scope 1 and 2 emissions following the closure of our coal-fired power stations ranges from approximately $21/tCO2e to $23/tCO2e,

Sustainability Report (Climate-Related Disclosures)
For the year ended 30 June 2025
Further controls and mitigation
AGL’s management of climate-related physical risks is grounded in our commitment to being net zero for Scope 1 and 2 emissions following
the closure of our coal-fired power stations. This commitment along with others outlined in our CTAP are intended to progress and support
action on climate change to limit warming.
Through these measures AGL aims to contribute to the mitigation of climate-related physical hazards and the avoidance of a high-warming
"outcome as modelled in Scenario C. More specifically, AGL’s physical hazards are controlled and managed through AGL’s risk management"
process as outlined in Section 2.3.
"AGL’s asset portfolio is resilient to direct physical risks in part through its geographic distribution, which acts to dilute the impact of"
"location-specific acute impacts. The generation fleet is also technologically diverse, which provides increased resilience to the impacts of"
"specific physical effects, such as temperature increases on generation efficiency. In addition, water rights and supply security allow for"
certainty even in extensive drought conditions.
"AGL currently has comprehensive mitigation strategies in place in relation to bushfires and water security, as detailed in our FY23 TCFD"
Report which is available on our website.
7.5.4 Measurement of greenhouse gas emissions
"The table below outlines the boundary, methodology, inputs and assumptions associated with calculating our Scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse"
"gas emissions for AGL’s material sources, as set out in Section 7.4.1."
Scope 1 and 2 emissions are prepared in accordance with the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007. Immaterial Scope 1
sources have been calculated using Method 1 as stipulated for each emissions source in the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting
(Measurement) Determination 2008 (the Determination).1Scope 3 emissions estimates use methodologies which are aligned with the GHG
Protocol: Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard.

,"An assumed loss factor is applied to AGL’s pool generation, to account for the difference between pool"
,generation and sales to customers on the same basis.
,"For the calculation of Scope 3 emissions from the supply of natural gas to customers, this includes an"
