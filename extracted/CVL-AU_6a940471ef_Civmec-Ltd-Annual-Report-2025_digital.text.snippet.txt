Since FY18, Civmec has paid A$106.1 million to 
investors in dividends, equivalent to 20.9 cents per 
share (excluding the final dividend of 3.5 cents). The final 
dividend is scheduled to be paid on 24 October 2025.
People 
As always, our people are integral to the continued 
strength and success of our business. Across FY25, 
Civmec directly employed more than 2,800 individuals 
and, when factoring in subcontractors and labour hire, 
that number reached approximately 3,350. Altogether, 
we contributed A$407 million into the Australian 
economy through wages and salaries.
The prioritisation of succession planning and employee 
professional development in recent years has resulted 
in a depth of talent that extends through multiple layers 
of the business. In August, we announced that Bojan 
Cica would take up the role of CFO, a position previously 
held as part of a dual COO/CFO role by Kevin Deery. 
Having been with the company since 2019, Bojan had 
proven himself to be a worthy successor to continue the 
excellent work that Kevin had delivered. To date, Bojan 
has met that expectation, most notably through his 
recent contributions to the acquisition of Luerssen.
In operational roles, the leadership depth that we have 
been developing has also paid dividends, and as we 
worked this year to grow our maintenance division, we 
were able to fill new Operations Manager roles with 
existing employees. These are just a few examples of how our commitment 
to developing strong leaders at all levels ensures we have 
many capable personnel ready to step into opportunities 
as they arise.
I would like to acknowledge our three new independent 
directors who were voted onto the Board at the 2024 
AGM: Mr Ambrose Law, Ms Ong Beng Hong and 
Mr Gary Gray. Their collective experience and far-
reaching business expertise have already brought fresh 
perspectives and valuable insights, and I look forward to 
the input they will continue to have with the Group.  
I would also like to take this opportunity to recognise 
and sincerely thank our previous independent directors 
– Mr Chong Teck Sin, Mr Wong Fook Choy Sunny and 
Mr Douglas Chester – for their unwavering commitment 
and support of the business over the many years of 
their tenure. Their guidance played a significant part in 
shaping the company to what it is today.
This year, we averaged more than 100 apprentices, 
trainees and graduates consistently across the business 
each month, and delivered almost 2,000 units of 
competency training through our in-house Registered 
Training Organisation. Our Graduate Program has gone 
from strength to strength – we now conduct an intake 
every January and June – and I was proud to see several 
talented engineering graduates from previous years’ 
intakes complete the program this year. We remain 
committed to nurturing talent and providing career 
pathways that strengthen both our company and the 
industry more broadly.  We have successfully continued our Veterans’ 
Employment Program, which was officially recognised 
this year with the Department of Veterans’ Affairs naming 
Civmec an ‘Employer of Choice’. Since the program’s 
launch in 2023, we have welcomed many veterans 
whose dedication and values shine through every day. 
Their contributions extend well beyond their own roles, 
influencing teams around them and reinforcing the 
positive culture we work hard to uphold. 
Sustainability 
At Civmec, we know that long-term success is 
dependent on responsible, transparent and ethical 
business practices. Over the past year, we have 
continued to build on our sustainability commitments, 
supporting both established and emerging green 
energy projects, while also working to reduce our own 
environmental impact. 
As I mentioned in last year’s report, our Board has 
endorsed a Net Zero Emissions by 2050 target. I am 
pleased to say we have continued to work towards this 
target and remain focused on cutting our Scope 1 and 
Scope 2 emissions intensity by more than 50% by 2030, 
using 2022 as our baseline. You can find more detail in 
the > Sustainability section of this report. 
Sustainable projects, such as the Christmas Creek 
Green Metal Project awarded by Fortescue in April 2025, 
remain an important part of our business. They allow us 
to contribute to reduced emissions targets and support 
sustainable development through our manufacturing and 
construction expertise. These efforts go hand in hand 
with changes we are making within our own operations, 
such as installing solar panels at our Newcastle facility  
to help lower our carbon footprint. 
Sustainability is an ongoing journey, and I am proud 
of the progress we have made. We are committed to 
staying the course and continuing to play our part in 
building a greener, more sustainable future.Outlook
In many ways, FY25 has reaffirmed our belief in the 
strength and adaptability of the Civmec business. While 
some financial results have not reached previous peaks, 
the fundamentals of our business remain strong – and 
our resolve has only grown. 
Encouragingly, we are seeing increased activity and 
engagement around the government’s proposed 
multi-billion-dollar investment at Henderson and 
Fleet Base West, alongside future naval shipbuilding 
opportunities. The Commonwealth has begun issuing 
expressions of interest (EOIs) and market sounding 
requests, signalling that the outlined infrastructure 
development activity is progressing. These developments 
reinforce Henderson’s strategic importance in national 
defence priorities, and I believe our proven capabilities in 
the defence and infrastructure sectors, combined with 
our location, leave us extremely well placed to play a  
lead role in the multi-billion-dollar defence and 
infrastructure program.  
We have tendered strongly throughout the year,  
with a strong pipeline of prospective work currently  
under review. Our focus going forward will be on 
converting opportunities into secured work, delivering 
to the exceptional standard we are known for, and 
continuing to build value by investing in strategic growth 
areas such as our OEM, defence, and maintenance 
divisions. I believe these pillars will shape the next 
chapter of our growth and help further solidify Civmec’s 
role as one of Australia’s most trusted delivery partners 
across our sectors. 
To our shareholders, thank you for your continued 
confidence in our business. Your support drives us 
forward, and we remain committed to delivering returns 
in a manner that is responsible, sustainable, and 
grounded in long-term value creation. 
To our Board, leadership team, employees, clients, 
suppliers and partners – thank you. Your ongoing effort 
is appreciated and valued. It is a privilege to work 
alongside people who care about what we do and how 
we do it. Together, we can look forward to FY26 with 
determination and optimism.

As the Board of Civmec Limited, we 
remain committed to overseeing the 
company’s sustainability agenda 
and ensuring our approach delivers 
long-term, sustainable value.
For Civmec, this means continuing to operate with 
integrity; actively contributing to the success and welfare 
of people and communities; ensuring operations have 
minimal environmental impact; and achieving health, 
safety, environmental and financial targets. 
During FY25, the Board maintained its clear focus on 
material risks and opportunities and ensuring these 
were effectively integrated into the company’s overall 
corporate strategy. 
We continue to advance towards our long-term climate 
goals, including our commitment to achieving net zero 
emissions by 2050, as well as our interim target to 
reduce Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions intensity by 
50% by 2030 (compared to our 2022 levels). 
In relation to climate-related disclosures, the Board has 
been monitoring changes in the regulatory landscape. 
Following the disbandment of the Task Force on Climate-
related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) in October 2023 
and the integration of its framework into the International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) for sustainability 
disclosures – now adopted by both the SGX and ASX – 
the company has decided to retain TCFD terminology for 
this reporting period to ensure clarity and consistency. As we prepare to transition to IFRS-aligned disclosures in 
future reports, regular updates on TCFD, IFRS and other 
sustainability matters will continue to be communicated 
to the Board from management.   
Throughout the year, investments were made into people 
and communities, including, but not limited to, training 
and development of employees, leadership and upskilling 
programs, recruitment and employment of veterans and 
graduates, Indigenous collaborations, and philanthropic 
efforts to support those less fortunate.  
A key area of progress this year was the improvement  
of systems for vetting suppliers, particularly to identify 
and address risks relating to modern slavery and  
human rights. Strengthening this framework has 
enhanced transparency and accountability across 
Civmec’s supply chain. 
The Board will continue to monitor Civmec’s progress 
and ensure the company’s sustainability practices meet 
stakeholder expectations, regulatory requirements, and 
the long-term best interests of the business.
Sincerely, 
Civmec Limited BoardThis report details our approach to 
sustainability-related matters and 
provides transparency on how our 
business operates accordingly. 
We have reported our sustainability disclosures against 
selected Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) Standards – a 
common set of metrics that allows us to benchmark our 
own performance over time, at the same time promoting 
consistency and comparability between us and other 
companies. A GRI content index is located on  
> page 229 of this report.
Our sustainability processes are subject to internal 
review, and we have an internal Sustainability Committee 
who provides a structured advisory forum to improve 
governance on sustainability issues. The Committee 
reports to the Civmec Executive Team, making 
recommendations on sustainability-related risks, 
opportunities, initiatives and performance, and the 
Executive Team is overseen by the Board of Directors.   
In FY25, we continued to strengthen our approach 
to sustainability governance and disclosure. Within 
this report, we have our third climate-related risk and 
opportunity assessment under the Task Force on 
Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD) framework. 
The Board received regular updates from management 
on climate-related matters and remains actively engaged 
with preparations for anticipated mandatory climate 
reporting in both Singapore and Australia. Further details 
on our TCFD disclosures can be found on > page 56. 
Stakeholders and Materiality
Civmec identifies, refines and evaluates potential 
sustainability issues that could affect our key 
stakeholders by conducting materiality assessments. 
Our key stakeholders include employees, partners, 
subcontractors, suppliers, clients, and communities. 
The outcomes of our materiality assessments are 
incorporated into our overall business strategies and 
sustainability targets. 
Civmec conducted a materiality workshop in FY24, with 
subject matter experts identifying the material topics 
most relevant to the business for a three-year timeframe, 
which includes FY25.  
The top five materiality categories, in order of priority, 
were identified as:
• cyber security;
• climate;
• business ethics;
•  people (attraction, retention and development); and
• health and safety.No material changes to sustainability-related risks  
were reported by the Risks and Conflicts Committee 
during FY25.
Sustainable Development Goals
In 2015, the United Nations introduced 17 Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) as part of its 2030 Agenda 
for Sustainable Development. 
At Civmec, we are committed to supporting these  
global goals and recognise the role we can play in 
advancing them through responsible and sustainable 
business practices. 
We currently identify our strongest areas of influence as 
reducing inequalities, ensuring responsible consumption 
and production, focusing on industry innovation, 
inclusion, resilient infrastructure, climate action and 
partnerships for the goals. 
We also acknowledge that our capacity to contribute 
meaningfully to each SDG varies depending on the 
nature of the goal. 
Throughout this report, SDG icons are presented at 
the beginning of each section. Their order reflects our 
assessment of where our impact is greatest, arranged 
from highest to lowest perceived influence.
