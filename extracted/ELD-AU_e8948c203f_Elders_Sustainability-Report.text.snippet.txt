Scope 1 and 2 emissions
Our emissions pro/f_ile reflects our emissions between 1 July 2023 and 30 June 2024, and was calculated using the following 
methodologies.
• For electricity usage: The methodology used is set out in the National Greenhouse and Energy (Measurement) 
Determination 2008 (as updated from time to time). Speci/f_ically, Elders utilises the NGER emissions and energy threshold 
calculator to calculate its scope 2 emissions and energy usage.
• For fuel use: The methodology used is set out in the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (Measurement) 
Determination 2008(as updated from time to time). Speci/f_ically, Elders' utilises the NGER emissions and energy threshold 
calculator to calculate fuel emissions and energy usage.
• For cattle production: the methodology set out in the Greenhouse Gas Accounting Framework for Feedlots and the Sheep 
and Beef Accounting Framework (Monthly) produced by the University of Melbourne and based on the Australian National 
Greenhouse Gas Inventory methodology. These methodologies are unable to account for sequestered carbon from 
minimum till farming practices at the feedlot or speci/f_ic manure and fertiliser management practices used by the feedlot.
Further information on our energy, emissions
and procurement of LGCs is contained in the
performance tables on page 56.For more information on the methodologies used by Elders, please see our Basis of Preparation on page 68

Scope 3 Emissions
Our Scope 3 emissions represent emissions along our value chain. Our Scope 3 emissions include emissions from business travel which, from 
1 July  2023  to 30 June  2024,  generated 1,795  tCO2e for flights and 252 tCO2e for hotel stays. During FY24,  we sought to make use of more 
sustainable hotel options, which has resulted in a reduction in average emissions per night at hotels from 0.094  tCO2e in FY23  to 0.077  tCO2e 
in FY24.10
During FY24,  we made progress towards measuring our Scope 3 emissions by defining  which of the Scope 3 emissions categories are relevant 
to our business and, accordingly, within our scope 3 boundary, having regard to the criteria set out in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol - Corporate 
Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard. The outcome of this activity is set out below, although the materiality of each 
category is yet to be quantified.
Through our Integrated Reporting Working Group, we will seek to progress with the measurement of our emissions to achieve compliance with 
the Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards, with next year focusing on the identification  of the most appropriate calculation methods to 
be applied. The measurement of Scope 3 emissions is complex, and our approach will be iterative. We look forward to providing updates on our 
progress in future sustainability reports.

Our Climate Targets
Our climate targets apply to the sites over which Elders has operational control.11 Our targets are informed by a number of sources, including the 
Paris Agreement, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's assessment reports, commitments made by Australian States and Territories 
and commitments made by other organisations in Australia and internationally, including those in the agriculture sector.

Our Performance and Emission Reduction Initiatives
The following section outlines our progress against our climate targets. Our Eight Point Plan aims to expand our product portfolio, services, 
geographic presence, and channels, which could increase our carbon footprint as our business grows. To manage this, we have set a target to 
reduce our Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity (tCO2e/$m  revenue) by 2030,  using 2021  as our baseline year. In 2024,  our overall emissions were 
57 ,210  tCO2e, down from 59,551  tCO2e in FY23.  This decrease is primarily due to a reduction in Killara-owned cattle on the Killara Feedlot, and an 
increase in cattle on the feedlot's custom fed program. Cattle on the feedlot's custom fed program are not owned by Killara and, accordingly, 
are not included in our Scope 1 emissions. Additionally, this is the first year that emissions have been calculated for the feedlot's grass-fed 
program, as this program has increased in size throughout FY24.  Notwithstanding the decrease in our emissions, our emissions intensity 
increased, from 17 .9 tCO2e/$m  revenue in 2023  to 18.3  tCO2e/$m  revenue in 2024.  This increase was driven by lower business revenue in FY24 
as compared to FY23.
To progress against our 2030  target while growing our business, we need to further address emissions from our fleet and feedlot cattle which is 
dependent on the availability of commercially viable technology. For additional details on our emission reduction initiatives, please refer to the 
following page.
