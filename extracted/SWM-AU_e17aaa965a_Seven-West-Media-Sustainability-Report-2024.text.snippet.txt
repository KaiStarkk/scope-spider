Seven West Media’s Sustainability Report, initiated in 
2022, offers a comprehensive review of our sustainability 
efforts for FY24. Our report is structured around the four 
key pillars of our sustainability strategy:
• Providing opportunities for future generations
• Uniting people and communities 
• Representing Australia
• Bringing awareness to environmental issues
These pillars guide us in delivering the most meaningful 
positive outcomes for our people, communities, and the 
environment.
Alongside this, we provide further detail on key areas of 
activity – such as our emissions reduction efforts, our key 
partnerships, and the important causes we support with 
the power of our platform by providing Community Service 
Announcement (CSA) airtime.
We developed our sustainability strategy through an in-
depth process of consultation with internal and external 
stakeholders, and by assessing Seven West Media’s long-
term existing sustainability initiatives.
As part of this process, Seven West Media adopted the 
United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 
as a framework to provide us with a clear path forward 
on our sustainability journey. Seven West Media supports 
the SDGs, which are recognised as a key benchmark for 
progress on sustainability matters.  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF COUNTRY 
Seven West Media respectfully acknowledges the lands, 
waterways and sky country – the traditional homelands of 
our First Peoples. From the Gadigal of Sydney, the Turrbal 
and Jagera of Brisbane, the Kulin nations of Melbourne, 
the Noongar of Perth, the Kaurna Peoples of Adelaide and 
everywhere in between. 
We pay our heartfelt respects to the Traditional 
Custodians of the land throughout Australia, 
community Elders and the teachers who are sharing the 
intergenerational knowledge and education as we work 
side-by-side in a new era of interconnectedness.

A Letter From Our CEO
Our sustainability strategy is not just about adhering to 
regulations and meeting expectations; it’s about genuinely 
contributing to the well-being and progress of our society. 
In June, I had the privilege of appearing before the Joint 
Select Committee on Social Media and Australian Society. 
As a father of two teenagers, I shared my personal concerns 
about the pervasive influence of unregulated misinformation 
and the emotional toll of online scams, exclusion and 
bullying. These issues are not just abstract concerns; 
they are real, affecting families and communities across 
Australia. It is in this context that Seven West Media’s role 
becomes crucial.
Seven West Media invests over $250 million a year in 
generating news content. We employ more than 1,500 
journalists, producers, editors, camera operators, and 
support staff dedicated to creating and distributing news 
content across the nation. Our reach is extensive, covering 
55 towns and cities nationwide. In Western Australia 
alone, we connect with 84% of the population through our 
metropolitan, regional and community media platforms.
Our commitment to delivering balanced, accurate and 
regulated news content sets us apart. Unlike unregulated 
social media platforms, our content is subject to rigorous 
compliance and editorial codes. 
In February 2024, we launched The Nightly, a new national 
digital news platform covering politics, policy, business, 
and culture. Featuring content from esteemed sources 
including The New York Times, The Economist, CNBC 
and others, The Nightly furthers our goal of delivering 
trusted news by providing premium quality journalism to 
Australians, free of charge.Beyond our media responsibilities, Seven West Media  
is deeply committed to supporting our communities.  
In 2023, the Perth Telethon raised a record $78 million to 
support sick children, thanks to the incredible generosity 
of West Australians. This funding is being channelled into 
136 children’s charities, beneficiaries and community 
organisations, advancing medical research and providing 
essential services, equipment, and programs for sick and 
vulnerable children and their families across Western 
Australia. Since its inception in 1968, Telethon has raised 
over $600 million.
Similarly, the 2024 Good Friday Appeal, broadcast on 
Channel 7 Melbourne and nationally on 7plus, raised a 
record $23.4 million for The Royal Children’s Hospital 
in Melbourne. This funding will enable the hospital to 
continue providing world-class care and conducting vital 
research. The event, highlighted by performances from top 
entertainers and appearances by popular Seven Network 
personalities, brought the community together in support  
of a common cause.
Our commitment to equality and representation is evident 
in our continued partnerships and initiatives. We have 
once again been named an Employer of Choice for Gender 
Equality by the Workplace Gender Equality Agency. We 
also marked our fourth year as the official broadcast 
partner with UN Women Australia for International Women’s 
Day, reinforcing our joint commitment to gender equality 
and celebrating the accomplishments of women.Environmental sustainability remains a core focus for Seven 
West Media. We have continued our partnership with 
Planet Ark to drive positive behavioural change around 
critical environmental issues. As the Official Media Partner 
of National Recycling Week and National Tree Day, we 
are proud to support Planet Ark, one of Australia’s leading 
environmental behaviour change organisations.
We are pleased to see an 18 per cent reduction in our scope 
1 and 2 emissions since FY22 resulting from a combination 
of grid decarbonisation and our own initiatives, specifically 
consolidation of premises in Sydney and ongoing energy 
efficiency measures, including introducing LED lighting 
across a number of our offices.
Our FY24 Sustainability Report is not just a summary of our 
achievements; it is a reflection of our enduring commitment 
to the communities we serve, the environment we cherish 
and the values we uphold. We are proud of the progress 
we have made, and we remain steadfast in our mission to 
create a positive and lasting impact.
Yours sincerely,
Jeff Howard
Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer
Seven West MediaI am pleased to present to you the FY24 Sustainability Report, a testament to our ongoing commitment to making  
a positive impact in the communities where we operate.

                 •Employee engagementWe regularly seek feedback from our stakeholders on 
our sustainability reporting to ensure we understand and 
reflect the issues that are most critical to them.
The issues identified as most material help to direct our 
sustainability strategy and pillars across environmental, 
social, and governance factors. We consistently see social 
issues as front-of-mind, and this is reflected strongly 
in our pillars, including our role in uniting people and 
communities across Australia, representing and reflecting 
our nation’s diversity through our platforms, and providing 
better opportunities for future generations to thrive.
Environmental issues are also important to us, and our 
approach to these reflects our ability to use our platforms 
and reach to raise awareness for vital causes, like our 
partnership with Planet Ark, as well as making meaningful 
improvements in how we operate sustainably in our 
business, like reducing our energy use.
Governance is also a critical focus, with responsible 
broadcasting and advertising and adherence to  
data security and privacy policies clearly reflected  
in our strategy. 
Our most material sustainability issues are identified in  
our materiality assessment.
