d) For these (min. two pr ioritized impact areas) : Performance measurement : Has your bank 
identified which sectors & industries as well as  types of customers financed or invested in 
are causing the strongest act ual positive or negative impac ts? Please describe how you 
assessed the performance of these, using appr opriate indicators related to significant 
impact areas that apply to  your bank’s context.  
In determining priority areas for target-setting among its areas of most significant 
impact, you should consider the bank’s current performance levels, i.e. qualitative 
and/or quantitative indicators and/or proxies of the social, economic and environmental 
impacts resulting from the bank’s activities and provision of products and services. If 
you have identified climate and/or financial health&inclusion as your most significant 
impact areas, please also refer to the applicable indicators in the Annex .  
If your bank has taken another approach to assess  the intensity of impac t resulting from the 
bank’s activities and provis ion of products and servic es, please describe this.  
 
The outcome of this step will then also provide the baseline (incl. indicators) you can use for 
setting targets in two areas of most significant impact.

The BNK Financial Group recognize s the importance of the impact 
of financed emissions (Scope 3) through investments and loans in 
addition to the greenhouse gases (Sco pe 1&2) emitted directly or 
generated through energy consumpt ion. We measure Scope 1, 2, 
and 3 emissions annually and has established a financed 
emissions measurement system in 2023 for more accurate 
measurement and management. The BNK Financial Group 
discloses emissions for certain categories among the 15 categories 
of Scope 3 emissions (investm ents, purchased goods, fuel- and 
energy-related activities, business travel). We plan to enhance the 
calculation system for Scope 3 emi ssions to disclose  emissions for 
all categories and monitor emissions. 
 The total financed emissions for 2023 are 25.88 million tCO
2eq. 
Financed emissions are classified into seven asset groups 
according to PCAF standards: listed equity and corporate bonds, 
business loans and unlisted equity, pr oject finance, commercial real 
estate, mortgages, motor vehicle loans, and sovereign debt. They are measured by multiplying the carbon emissions of the borrower 
(source of emissions) by invest ment ratio of the BNK Financial 
Group (balance of financial assets / total assets of the borrower(source of emissions)).  Among these, the emissions 
corresponding to the asset groups of listed equity and corporate bonds, business loans and unlisted equity are classified into 12 
industries, and the emissions and intensity (emissions per unit 
investment amount) by asset group are as follows.

2.2 Target Setting (Key Step 2) 
Show that your bank has set and published a minimum of two targets which address at least 
two different areas of most significant impact that you identified in your impact analysis.  
The targets7 have to be Specif ic, Measurable (qualitative or  quantitative), Achievable, 
Relevant and Time-bound (SMART).  Please disclose the following elements of target setting 
(a-d), for each target separately: 
a) Alignment: which international, regional or national policy frameworks to align your bank’s 
portfolio with8 have you identified as relevant? Show that t he selected indicators and 
targets are linked to and drive alignment wi th and greater contribution to appropriate 
Sustainable Development Goals, the goals of  the Paris Agreement, and other relevant 
international, national or regional frameworks.  
You can build upon the context items under 2.1.

[Climate change mitigation] 
The BNK Financial Group has es tablished a step-by-step roadmap 
for achieving internal emissions Net Zero and financed emissions 
Net Zero in accordance with the Paris Agreement  and UN SDGs 
(SDG 13 Climate action). In 2024, the Scope 1, 2, 3 carbon 
reduction targets, based on a 1.5°C scenario, have obtained 
approval from the SBTi (Science-Based Targets initiative) and align with the Korean government's carbon neutrality goals  by 2050. 
 We have joined PCAF (Partnership for Carbon Accounting 
Financials), and have calculat ed the financed emissions in 
accordance with global standards,  utilizing the SBTi (Science-
Based Targets initiative) methodology when setting our Net Zero 
and interim goals.  We aim to achieve a 42% reduction in internal 
emissions by 2030 compared to 2022 levels and reach Net Zero by 
2045 by applying the Absolute Cont raction Approach (ACA). We 
have applied the Sectoral Decarbonization Approach (SDA) to financed emissions for power generation project finance, 
commercial real estate, cement and power generation sectors 
within corporate loans/bonds/sto cks. For other asset groups and 
sectors, we have applied the Tem perature Rating Approach (TRA). 
For sectors such as PF excluding power generation and motor vehicle loans, where SBTi met hodologies have not been provided, 
reduction targets have been set using the Absolute
 Contraction 
Approach (ACA), cons istent with the internal emissions 
measurement method. Through th is, we aim to achieve a 26% 
reduction in financed emissions by 2030 compared to 2022 levels, 
and reach Net Zero by 2050. 
 [Financial inclusion] The BNK Financial Group has es tablished a plan to provide 
14.7205 trillion KRW over three y ears from 2022, including support 
for low-income families, vulner able groups and economic recovery. 
It contributes to achi eving the UN SDGs (SDG 1 No poverty, SDG 8 
Decent work and economic growth, SDG 10 Reduced inequalities) 
and aligns with the Korean gover nment's direction emphasizing 
inclusive and win-win finance.  Links and references

[Climate change mitigation] The BNK Financial Group has es tablished Scope 1, 2, 3 carbon 
reduction targets that align with the Paris Agreement. By establishing detailed interim target s along with the final Net Zero 
targets, we have enhanced the feasibility and manageability of 
achieving these tar gets. By setting absol ute emissions-based 
targets, we aim to increase cons istency in long-term planning and 
reduce the substantial im pacts of climate change.

1.5°C scenario. For internal emissions, we have applied SBTi's 
Absolute Contraction Approach (A CA). For financed emissions, we 
have included not only the companies’ Scope 1 & 2 but also Scope 3 emissions, and estab lished the detailed SB Ti-based targets by 
asset group and sectors, including carbon-intensive sectors. We 
have applied the Sector Decarbonization Approach (SDA) to power generation project finance, commercial real estate, cement and power generation sectors within the corporate l oans/bonds/stocks. 
For other asset groups and sectors, we have applied the 
Temperature Rating Approach (TRA ). For sectors such as PF 
excluding power generation and automobile loans, where SBTi methodologies have not been prov ided, reduction targets have 
been set using the Absolute Emis sion Reduction Approach (ACA), 
consistent with the internal em issions measurement method. For 
specific targets, please refe r to the SBTi Target Language and

2.3 Target implementation and monitoring (Key Step 2) 
For each target separately: 
Show that your bank has impl emented the actions it had previo usly defined to meet the set 
target.  
Report on your bank’s progress since the last r eport towards achieving each of the set targets 
and the impact your progress resulted in, usi ng the indicators and KPIs to monitor progress 
you have defined under 2.2. 
Or, in case of changes to impl ementation plans (relevant for 2nd and subsequent 
reports only): describe the potential chang es (changes to priority impact areas, changes to 
indicators, acceleration/review of targets, intr oduction of new milestones or revisions of action 
plans) and explain why those changes have becom e necessary. 
Response 
[Climate change  mitigation]  
The status of internal em issions (Scope 1&2) and financed 
emissions (Scope 3) for 2023 is as  follows. We have reviewed the 
achievement rate against the set target and established plans for 
achieving the targets for the next year. In the case of internal 
emissions, we have fulfilled our targets. However, for financed 
emissions, we exceeded the 2023 target by 2.33 million tCO 2eq 
due to an increase in financed emission s from the fossil fuel sector 
resulting from the expansion of energy assets. We plan to 
continuously manage this through the expansion of a low-carbon 
portfolio. For detailed performanc e on 11 detailed implementation 
tasks, please refer to pages 61- 66, 34-40, 26-27, and 68-70 of the 
Sustainability Report.
