Net Zero operational emissions by 2035
What we mean by ‘Net Zero Operational Emissions’
Net Zero
An absolute reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 
90-95% percent, with the remaining 5-10% emissions 
that are not possible to cut, neutralised through 
carbon removals. This is aligned to 1.5°C aligned 
warming pathways. 
Operational Emissions
We remain committed to our target to achieve net zero 
operational emissions by 2035. 
Traditionally this means a reduction in our Scope 1 and 
2 emissions.
We believe that through our solar PV and microgrid 
program of work, we can provide access to renewables 
for our homeowners, which means that we can directly 
influence their emissions profile at the source. We can 
also influence the type of grid electricity being drawn 
into our communities through our embedded network/
microgrid configurations. Therefore, our target encompasses:
Scope 1 Direct emissions:  On-site gas use by LIC for 
common facilities, fuel used for LIC vehicles
Scope 2 Purchased electricity:  Electricity used by LIC 
managed facilities
Scope 3 Indirect emissions:  Energy used by 
homeowners in LIC Communities.
These categories align with the boundaries of what we 
currently measure in our Greenhouse Gas Inventory 
(GHG Inventory).Climate action

Journey to 
Net Zero 2035
* We recognise that we may have left over emissions that are difficult to reduce.  
We will work to fund high quality offsets for those emissions. Operational emissions
We remain committed to our target to achieve 
net zero operational emissions by 2035.
Traditionally this means a reduction in our 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions. However, due to the 
unique nature of our communities and our 
operational control of the energy procurement 
mix, we have expanded this target to include 
All electric new developments
New developments are 100% 
electric. Continued focus on 
innovation and design changes 
to improve efficiency.Improve efficiency
Use latest technology to 
make new communities 
more efficient, and influence 
behaviour change where we 
can. Progressively upgrade 
equipment at older communities 
to improve efficiency over time.
Buy where we can’t generate

Measure, report and track
Measure and report on

homeowners’ energy use.
We believe that through our solar PV and 
microgrid program of work, we can provide 
access to renewables for our homeowners – 
which means that we can directly influence 
their emissions profile at the source.

and continuous improvement
Our developments in progress involve a mix of 
construction usage and homeowner usage. As such, 
we acknowledge that some of the data from our 
developing sites may not provide an accurate picture 
of our emissions split between development and 
operations. 
Our reported total emissions are accurate to the best 
of our knowledge and based on metered data. We 
are working to develop more accurate reporting and 
monitoring systems across our communities and will 
learn from the challenges of applying our boundaries to 
developing communities.Climate action
