2024 has been a year of significant activity 
for our teams, putting our technical and 
environmental expertise, and stakeholder 
relationships to the test. As I reflect on the 
year, it became apparent to me that 2024 has 
been about accountability and continuing to 
demonstrate that WAF upholds its commitments 
to our communities, workforce, the Government 
of Burkina Faso, and our shareholders.
Key Developments in 2024
A substantial portion of our efforts in 2024 has revolved 
around the development of the Kiaka Project. Upon acquiring 
the project in 2022, we inherited not only a mining permit with 
specific construction milestones but also over a decade of 
community expectations for job creation and development. It 
became our responsibility to fulfill these expectations. Between 
then and the end of 2024, we refined the project design which 
not only resulted in improved project economics but reduced 
its land take footprint and associated impacts. We updated  
the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) and 
Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) to reflect these changes and 
align with current social and environmental context, leading to 
the renewal of the project’s Environmental Certificate. While 
we achieved our 2024 targets, what stands out for me above 
all metrics is the dedication, hard work and compassion 
demonstrated by our teams. While our primary focus has been on the Kiaka Project, I would 
like to acknowledge the Sanbrado Community Relations and 
Environment Departments for their valuable guidance and 
support to the Kiaka and Toega teams. Throughout 2024, a 
number of information exchange and collaboration sessions 
took place where the Sanbrado teams shared comprehensive 
insights into their plans, procedures and projects to assist 
with the development of Kiaka and Toega’s Environmental and 
Social Management Systems and social programs.
I am also proud of our corporate sustainability team for their 
proactive approach in adopting the GRI 14: Mining Sector 
2024 standard ahead of its effective date of January 2026. 
This provides a reporting framework that better focuses on 
material topics relevant to the mining industry. Additionally, we 
are preparing for compliance with the Australian Sustainability 
Reporting Standards (AASB), which includes:
 +Assurance: Commencing assurance of Scope 1 and 
2 greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption 
presented in this Sustainability Report. 
 +Climate Change Risk Assessment: Conducting a Climate 
Change Risk Assessment to identify climate-related risks 
and opportunities. The risk assessment will be presented to 
the WAF Board of Directors in Q1 2025 and integrated into 
future reporting.
In 2024, we introduced a Tailings Storage Facility (TSF) 
Management Policy as we continue integrating the Global 
Industry Standard on Tailings Management (GISTM) into our practices. We also presented a Biodiversity Strategy to the WAF 
Board of Directors, which was given their approval in Q1 2025. 
The strategy aims to harmonise WAF’s approach to biodiversity 
management across our operations. 
Looking Ahead
As we transition into 2025, I am looking forward to building on 
the momentum we have gained this year. In 2025, we expect 
to see the first gold pour at Kiaka and the start of construction 
for the Toega project. Reporting on our environmental, social 
and governance performance will be expanded providing 
stakeholders with even greater insight into the practices we 
implement to achieve our aim of creating a positive mining 
legacy.

Report and Scope
This report presents the activities of West African 
Resources Limited’s corporate office in Perth, 
Australia and exploration and mining activities 
carried out by its subsidiaries in Burkina Faso. 
In this report, ‘WAF’ and ‘the Company’ refer to West African 
Resources Limited and ‘WAF Group’, ‘we’ and ‘our’ refer to 
the Company and, or through, its operating subsidiaries, 
unless otherwise explicitly stated.  A full list of the Company’s 
subsidiaries can be found in the 2024 Annual Report.  The 
management approaches described in this report apply to 
the Group, however statistical information is focused on 
the Sanbrado Gold Mine, the Kiaka Gold Project (under 
construction) and the Toega gold deposit (commencing mining 
in 2025), in addition to WAF’s corporate office. 
This report covers a reporting period of 1 January 2024 to 
31 December 2024 (aligned with financial reporting in the 
Company’s 2024 Annual Report). Reports are prepared 
annually and information from the previous reporting period 
has been included where it provides the context necessary for 
comparing performance or as background information. 
References in this report to $ are to Australian Dollars, unless 
otherwise stated. 
Publication date: April 2025.
Reporting Approach
This Sustainability Report (Report) has been prepared following 
the Global Reporting Initiative Sustainability Reporting 
Standards 2021 (GRI Standards), including GRI 14: Mining 
Sector Standard published in 2024 which will come into effect 1 January 2026. Information was collated by the WAF 
Sustainability Department in consultation with project Heads 
of Department. This Report and supporting information are 
available online at WAF’s website:  
www.westafricanresources.com 
This Report presents an update on WAF’s performance in 2024 
across environmental, social and governance (ESG) topics 
deemed to be material to our operations and our influence 
on those topics. Our approach to managing material topics 
is described in the section titled Management of Material 
Topics. In conjunction with this Report, the related performance 
data and statistical information is presented in the 2024 
Sustainability Databook available on WAF’s website.
Materiality Assessment Process
WAF applies a dual materiality approach to understand WAF 
Group’s impacts on its environmental, social, and governance 
(ESG) context and the potential impacts of these issues on the 
Company itself.  
Assessment of ESG risks is informed by:
 +enterprise-level risk assessments;
 +project-specific environmental and social impact 
assessments (ESIA);  
 +stakeholder feedback and audits; and
 +impact of global events and gold mining industry trends. 
Each year, WAF conducts an enterprise-level risk assessment 
to evaluate both local and global risks relevant to the Company 
and to determine the adequacy of existing controls and 
mitigation measures. This process involves a comprehensive 
review and analysis of each business unit, carried out by 
the General Manager of Risk and the respective business 
 Legal entity that owns rights to the project/deposit Project/deposit name
Société des Mines de Sanbrado SA Sanbrado Gold Mine (‘Sanbrado’ or ‘SOMISA’)
Kiaka SA Kiaka Gold Project (‘Kiaka’)
Toega SA (previously, Kiaka Gold SARL) Toega gold deposit (‘Toega ’), previously, held under an 
exploration licence by Kiaka Gold SARL)unit manager. As part of this process, we recognise that 
stakeholder concerns vary across different projects areas.  
To capture these nuances, we undertake direct engagement 
with local stakeholders, including project affected 
communities, employees, government bodies, and NGOs. An 
essential tool in this process is the grievance mechanisms that 
have been implemented at Sanbrado, Kiaka and Toega, which 
set out a procedure for stakeholders to raise concerns and 
provide insights into emerging risks and material issues at the 
relevant site. 
The findings of the enterprise-level risk assessment are 
reviewed by WAF’s Board of Directors Risk Committee, which 
meets twice a year. The 2024 enterprise-level risk assessment 
did not identify new or emerging ESG risks. A summary of 
stakeholder feedback is presented in Our Stakeholders.
This Sustainability Report also incorporates relevant ESG 
topics outlined in the new GRI 14: Mining Sector Standard, 
which aims to provide greater insight into ESG issues of particular relevance to mining operations.  This ensures that 
our materiality assessment remains responsive and reflects 
global sustainability commitments, industry-specific risks and 
local priorities. 
The complete list of material topics addressed in this Report 
is presented in the GRI Content Index and described in 
Management of Material Topics. 
Approving Entity
This Report has been approved for release by the Board of 
Directors of West African Resources Limited.
Third-party limited assurance has been provided by Bureau 
Veritas of the Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions and 
energy consumption presented in this Report. Refer to Limited 
Assurance Statement.

Managing  Our  Environmental FootprintAlignment with Australian Sustainability Reporting Standard S2: 
Climate-related Disclosures
In September 2024, the Australian Accounting 
Standards Board (AASB) published the 
Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards, 
which closely align with the international 
benchmark: the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure 
Standards. 
The Australian Standards comprise:
 +S1: General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-
related Financial Information [for which disclosure is 
voluntary]; and 
 +S2: Climate-related Disclosures [for which disclosure is 
mandatory for WAF]. 
To ensure compliance with AASB S2 starting from 1 January 
2025, WAF is pursuing a work program to collect and report 
the necessary information. In 2024, we engaged Foresight 
Consulting Group (Foresight) to undertake a scenario-based 
assessment of risks and opportunities across our operations 
and value chain. The assessment adopted a high emission 
scenario (SSP 5/RCP 8.5) and low emission scenario (SSP 1/
RCP 2.6) and considered risks and opportunities over three 
industry standard time horizons (2030, 2050 and 2090).The initial stage was a qualitative assessment of risks and 
opportunities in alignment with the recommendations of the 
Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), 
the Australian Sustainability Reporting Standard S2 and 
ISO 31000:2018 Risk Management. This assessment 
identified physical and transition risks, under the high 
emissions scenario and low emissions scenario respectively. 
The assessment also provided an analysis of WAF’s current 
alignment with AASB S2 and a path forward for meeting the 
disclosure requirements. 
In 2025, WAF will undertake a decarbonisation study to 
identify and prioritise emissions reduction opportunities 
which maximise both financial and environmental outcomes. 
This will inform preparation of a robust transition plan. 
Foresight also supported WAF in 2024 to provide a review 
of our in-house Scope 1 and 2 calculations, as well as 
developing a bespoke Scope 3 emissions calculator, which 
will enable reliable and consistent calculation and reporting 
of emissions going forward. These initiatives also put us in a 
strong position in advance of the introduction of mandatory 
assurance of emissions reporting, under AASB S2. Key environmental metrics 2024 2023 2022GHG
