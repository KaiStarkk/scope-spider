"TNFD, September 2023.",
Adaptation,Human systems adapt by adjusting to actual or expected climate and its effects to lessen harm or take advantage of beneficial opportunities. Ecological systems adapt by adjusting to the
,"actual climate and its effects, which may be facilitated by human intervention."
Adaptation limits,The point at which the needs of human or ecological systems can no longer be secured from intolerable risks through adaptive actions. Two limits can be distinguished:
,"•
Hard adaptation limit: the intolerable risks can no longer be avoided through adaptation actions"
,"•
Soft adaptation limit: intolerable risk can be avoided through options, but these are currently not available"
Atmosphere,"The atmosphere is the four realms of nature, and includes the gaseous medium and its suspended particulate liquids and solids above land."
Biodiversity,"The variability of living organisms from all sources, which includes the diversity within species, between species and of ecosystems."
Biome,"Zones on a global scale, generally determined by the type of plant life they support as a result of average precipitation and temperature patterns, such as savannas or tundras."
Dependencies (on nature),"Those aspects relating to environmental assets and ecosystem services that a person or an organisation relies on to function properly, such as water flow and the regulation of hazards like"
,floods and fires.
Ecosystem,"A functional interconnected unit comprising a dynamic system of plant, animal and micro-organism communities and the non-living environment."
Ecosystem services,The services or contributions made by ecosystems that benefit economic and other human activities.
Exposure,"The existence of people, economic, social or cultural assets, infrastructure, livelihoods, ecosystems and their functions and the like, in places and settings that could be negatively affected."
Hazard,"The potential for the occurrence of a natural or human-induced physical event or trend with adverse effects, such as loss of life, injury or health impacts, loss and damage to property,"
,ecosystems and environmental resources.
Impacts (on nature),"The impact or changes to the state of nature, whether in quality or quantity, and which may lead to changes to nature’s capacity to provide social and economic functions."
Köppen-Geiger,The Köppen-Geiger climate classification is a widely used system that categorises the world’s climates based on temperature and precipitation patterns.
Land,"One of the realms of nature which includes all dry land, and its vegetation cover, nearby atmosphere and substrate, and associated animals and microbes."
Mitigation,The action(s) implemented to reduce the extent of a negative impact.
Nature,"Nature comprises all life on Earth, including the geology, water, climate and all other inanimate components of Earth, which is made of four physical realms – land, ocean, freshwater and the"
,atmosphere. Each of these interact with people and society.
Ocean,"All connected saline ocean waters, characterised by waves, tides and currents."
Resilience,"Any system’s ability to bounce back, cope and return to a previous state after a disturbance to maintain its essential function, identity and structure and to still be able to adapt, learn and"
,transform.
Risk,"Risk can be used as a valuable framework to understand the interlinked and increasingly severe impacts of climate change on human systems, ecosystems and biodiversity. Risk is the"
,"potential for negative consequences for human or ecological systems, cognisant of the array of values and objectives underlying these systems. The interactions between climate-related"
,"hazards, and the exposure and vulnerability of affected human and ecological systems gives rise to risk."
Scope 1 GHG emissions,All direct GHG emissions.
Scope 2 GHG emissions,"Indirect GHG emissions from the consumption of purchased electricity, heat or steam."
Scope 3 GHG emissions,"Other indirect emissions not covered in Scope 2, that occur in the value chain of a reporting company, including both upstream and downstream emissions."
Vulnerability,"The tendency, or exposure to be negatively affected, determined by a system’s level of sensitivity to harm and its lack of capacity to cope and adapt."
