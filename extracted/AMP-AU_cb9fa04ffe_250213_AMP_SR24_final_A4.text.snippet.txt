funds and managed portfolios, across different asset classes and different fund managers. Managed funds and managed 
portfolios are unit trust based investments issued by a responsible entity, which are governed by the relevant fund manager’s 
responsible investment, ESG and voting policies.
Investments that are marketed or labelled as ‘sustainable’, ‘ethical’ or ‘ESG’ are assessed as part of our onboarding due diligence 
process which assesses investment options against a series of quantitative and qualitative metrics, which includes profiling 
questionnaires, third party ratings, and manager engagement to assess compliance with the stated investment objectives.
Advisers and clients have access to a growing range of responsible investment options through our platform. Through our 
MyNorth product, clients have access to over 75 responsible or sustainable investment options (unlisted managed funds 
and ETFs) certified by the Responsible Investment Association of Australasia (RIAA).
