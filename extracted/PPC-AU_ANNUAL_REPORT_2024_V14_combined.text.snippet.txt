undertake investigations or audits to confirm compliance with relevant regulations.
GREENHOUSE GAS AND ENERGY DATA REPORTING REQUIREMENTS 
The Group may be subject to the reporting requirements of the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007.  
This would require the Group to report its annual greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy use if it had operational 
control of facilities (sites) that emit greenhouse gases, produce energy, or consume energy at or above the specified 
GHG emission and energy thresholds per financial year.
The Group is not required to register and report to the Clean Energy Regulator as the Group does not have operational
