15.,"Total indirect GHG emissions (Scope 2) include indirect emissions from the consumption of purchased electricity. The Qantas Group applies the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (Measurement) Determination factors for the calculation of CO2-e,"
,except for tri-generation associated emissions where the Qantas Group applies a facility-specific emission factor. FY24 figure includes Scope 2 GHG emissions from operations in Los Angeles and London. Emission factors for the consumption of purchased
,electricity from the grid are updated annually to reflect changes in energy mix. Scope: All activities under operational control of the Qantas Group.
16.,Total indirect GHG emissions resulting from value chain activities (Scope 3) have been calculated in alignment with the GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting & Reporting Standard and the increase from FY23 is as a result of the
,expansion of the reporting boundary to include additional GHG Protocol categories. GHG Protocol Categories one to nine and 15 have been included within the reporting boundary. Categories 10 to 14 were assessed not to be relevant and therefore not
,included within the Group’s Scope 3 reporting boundary. Please refer to page 35 for further details on the Group’s Scope 3 GHG reporting.
17.,Total direct and indirect GHG emissions from domestic operations. Domestic operations include all emissions from activities reported under the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (Measurement) Determination.
18.,"Total direct and indirect GHG emissions from international operations. International operations include all emissions from international aviation fuel consumption, in addition to scope 1 and 2 emissions from the Group’s activities in Los Angeles and London."
19.,GHG emissions (Scope 1 and 2 only) intensity measured in kilograms of CO2-e per 100 revenue-tonne-kilometres (RTKs) converted to CO2-e tonnes by the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (Measurement) Determination factors. Scope: All flights
,"operated solely for the purpose of the Qantas Group, and all activities under the operational control of the Qantas Group."
20.   The total volume of aviation kerosene consumed by the Qantas Group’s flying businesses from 1 July to 30 June. Scope: Aviation fuel consumption where the flight is operated solely for the purpose of the Qantas Group. This includes both domestic and,
,"international operations: Qantas Airways, Jetstar Australia and New Zealand, QantasLink, Network Aviation and Qantas Freight. This does not include aviation fuel consumed by Jetstar Asia, Jetstar Japan or codeshare partners."
21.,"Fuel per 100 revenue-tonne-kilometres (RTKs). The amount of revenue-generating payload carried for the distance flown. The total number of tonnes of paying passengers, freight and mail carried, multiplied by the number of kilometres flown. Scope: Fuel"
,"per 100 RTKs includes domestic and international passenger/ freight operations (Qantas Airways, Jetstar Australia and New Zealand, QantasLink, Network Aviation and Qantas Freight including Jets trucking)."
