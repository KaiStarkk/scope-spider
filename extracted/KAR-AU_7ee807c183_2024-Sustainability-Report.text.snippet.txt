This report outlines the sustainability 
performance and strategy of Karoon 
Energy Limited (Karoon) for assets 
owned and operated by Karoon, 
including the Baúna Project (100%) 
and non-operated Who Dat (30%). 
This report, statistics and annual data 
therein cover the period 1st January 
2024 – 31st December 2024.
The people-related data included in 
this report, such as safety performance 
data, refer to workers associated 
with our operated assets, including 
contractors. It does not include 
people-related data associated with 
non-operated assets. Safety, Process 
Safety and Environment performance 
of non-operated assets is addressed 
under ‘Performance and Achievements’ 
in the appropriate section.
For emissions related data, such 
as Scope 1 and 2 emissions, the 
data included in this report reflects 
activities and assets under our 
operational control, such as the Baúna 
Project, as well as our interest in the 
Who Dat asset, which are reported  
on a net working interest basis.
All monetary amounts reported are 
in United States (US) dollars, unless 
otherwise stated. Karoon uses the term ‘sustainability’ 
when referring to the five pillars of our 
sustainability strategy: ‘health, safety 
and security, ‘climate’ , ‘people and 
culture’ , ‘community’ and ‘environment’ . 
Throughout this report, sustainability 
can refer to any one of these items 
and may be used interchangeably 
with each of these terms. Each use 
of the term sustainability should be 
understood in this context and in the 
specific context of the topic discussed. 
The metrics in this report should be 
read in conjunction with the footnotes 
and glossary in this report.
REPORTING FRAMEWORKS

Karoon prioritises safety above 
all else. In 2024, Baúna’s safety 
performance fell short with four 
recordable injuries, including two 
LTIs, a deterioration relative to 2023 
performance. We believe all incidents 
and injuries are preventable and  
have previously demonstrated that 
this can be achieved. We will enhance 
our vigilance, implement additional 
safety initiatives and strengthen 
existing controls in collaboration  
with our contractors.
There were no recordable safety 
incidents associated with the  
Who Dat operations.
The Company has continued its focus 
on further developing Process Safety 
Management and understanding. 
However, during 2024 there were two 
Tier 2 gas release events, compared 
to none in 2023. In response, further 
improvements in facility maintenance, 
inspection and Process Safety 
awareness will be undertaken during 
2025, working in close collaboration 
with the FPSO contractor.
Overall environmental performance 
remained good, with no significant 
incidents during the year. However, 
poor operational reliability at the 
Baúna Project resulted in higher gas 
flaring than planned. Improving the 
reliability of the FPSO is a high priority 
and is expected to materially reduce 
gas flaring in 2025.Our commitment to remain Carbon 
Neutral for Scope 1 and 2 emissions 
through the use of carbon offsets was 
met with the surrender of 204,071 
verified carbon units (VCUs), fully 
covering emissions from 1 July 2022 
to 31 December 2023. Our ability to 
meet future commitments was further 
strengthened with the execution of 
a five year agreement with Suzano 
S.A., to supply 100,000 high quality 
afforestation, reforestation and 
revegetation (ARR) credits per year.
Karoon has a strong record of 
engaging with and supporting those 
communities in which we operate, 
through our social and community 
programs. In 2024 our program in 
Brazil expanded to include four 
voluntary and eighteen incentivised 
projects, half of which were continued 
partnerships. This shows the 
importance we place on building 
lasting relationships with communities 
and local organisations.
In 2024, the Company reviewed its 
sustainability strategy and committed 
to continuing to minimise emissions 
where practical and to fully offset its 
operated Scope 1 and 2 emissions. 
In addition, recognising that future 
growth is likely to also increase 
absolute emissions, the Company  
will aim to reduce emissions intensity 
by 30% by 2032 from a 2021 baseline.The review considered many factors 
including current asset operational 
performance and potential future 
growth, as well as advancements 
in offshore emissions reduction 
technology. Consequently, the 
Company has updated its  
commitment to achieving ‘Net Zero  
by 2050 or sooner’ for Scope 1 
and Scope 2 emissions , replacing 
the previous target of 2035, while 
continuing to focus on reducing 
absolute emissions where practical 
and economical. Our Climate 
Transition Action Plan (CTAP) which 
will be developed in 2025, will specify 
Karoon’s approach and pathway  
to achieving Net Zero by 2050. INTRODUCTION
The Company is pleased to present the 2024 Sustainability Report, 
including Karoon’s first full year of operations at the Who Dat 
production asset in the Gulf of Mexico.

THE WAY  
WE WORK
Over the past twenty years Karoon has significantly evolved as  
a business, from our start as an exploration company in 2004,  
to a production company with the acquisition and operation  
of the Baúna Project and associated fields in 2020, and the 
acquisition in late 2023, of a non-operated interest in our  
second producing asset, Who Dat, in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Both offshore Brazil and the USA 
offer exposure to industry leading 
operations and technology, high 
quality oil and gas Reserves, and 
low emission intensity production. 
Our existing assets reflect Karoon’s 
aspiration to grow through strategic 
investment in such assets as we build 
our pathway towards Net Zero. 
Karoon’s priority is to safely, reliably 
and efficiently deliver value adding 
production and over the long term 
to grow as a business, leveraging 
opportunities to add high quality,  
high value, low emission intensity 
assets to our portfolio. Our six 
Strategic Pillars, ‘Sustainability 
and ESG; Operational Excellence; 
Organic Growth; Inorganic Growth; 
Organisational Culture and Design; 
and Funding’ support this aspiration.A key consideration influencing 
Karoon’s approach to sustainability  
is to meet and exceed where practical 
the evolving regulatory requirements 
and policy environment in the regions 
in which we operate. As Australia 
introduces mandatory climate-related 
reporting requirements, and Brazil 
introduces a ‘Cap-and-Trade’ emission 
trading system, Karoon is adapting 
to these changing conditions and 
aligning the Company to meet both 
local and global standards. 
While Karoon’s strategy is evolving 
to meet the needs of a growing 
international business, the values  
and priorities of the Company  
remain unchanged.

THE WAY WE WORK  CONTINUED
SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY 2021 SUSTAINABILITY STRATEGY RESULTS
2024 marked the successful 
completion of Karoon’s 2021 strategic 
plan. Under this plan, eleven 
sustainability targets were set, of 
these, eight have been fully achieved, 
two remain in progress and only one 
has not progressed due to market  
and business changes. 
The second half of 2024 saw the 
development of the next phase of 
Karoon’s sustainability strategy, 
working closely with Karoon’s 
executive leadership team and Board 
of directors to develop a sustainability 
strategy that supports the business, 
demonstrating continuous 
improvement and a positive impact. 
The original five pillars, namely  
health, safety and security, climate, 
people and culture, environment  
and community remain very relevant 
for us as a business and continue 
to be the framework on which our 
sustainability strategy is constructed.
Health, Safety and Security
1. Personal Safety
Karoon remains committed to 
managing our operations in a way  
that puts the health, safety and 
security of people first.
Our focus is to continue to mature 
our safety systems and to work 
collaboratively with our contractors 
and partners to reduce the risk of 
a serious injury for our workers. 
This includes focusing on hazard 
identification, risk management and 
incident investigation, as well as 
introducing physical improvements  
in our work environments.Goal Progress

Climate
Karoon’s long term target is to  
become a Net Zero Company for 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions, meaning  
a substantial reduction in operating 
carbon emissions over a given period,  
complemented by offsets for any 
residual emissions. As part of a 
sustainability strategy review, the 
Company elected to adopt a revised 
target of ‘Net Zero by 2050 or sooner’ 
for Scope 1 and 2 emissions in order to 
reflect the Company’s growth strategy, 
practical and economic opportunities 
to reduce emissions offshore, and 
alignment with industry norms and 
global trends. 
This change recognises the operating 
lessons we have learnt over the last 
four years as an operator and the 
unique challenges associated with 
decarbonising existing upstream 
assets due to their location and the 
environment in which they operate,  
as well as changes in our industry  
and the broader environment. 
In the medium term, as Karoon grows, 
CO 2 emissions from our producing 
assets will increase. T o balance this, 
we aim to reduce emission intensity 
through improved practices and  
new technologies. Although Karoon  
is already below the Oil and Gas 
Climate Initiative (OGCI) industry 
target of 17 kgCO 2e/boe1, we aim  
to improve further. 
Since 2021, we’ve reduced emission 
intensity by 21%, from 14.9 kgCO 2e/
boe to 11.7 kgCO 2e/boe in 2024. 
Future reductions will focus on steady 
operations, efficiency, and emission 
reduction technologies, guided by  
our Climate Transition Action Plan 
(CTAP) to be developed in 2025, along 
with selective growth opportunities.
In addition to these two primary 
goals, the Company is dedicated to 
remaining Carbon Neutral for Scope 1 
and 2 emissions. This will be achieved 
through the use of carbon offsets  
(see Metrics & T argets, page 22),  
with a focus on higher quality and 
higher permanence carbon credits. 
This has been an essential part of the 
Company’s sustainability strategy since becoming an operator.  
The commitment to improving  
the quality of the credits used and 
expanding to include non-operated 
assets on an equity basis reflects 
the Company’s commitment to 
continuous improvement.
Karoon recognises that while 
technology to reduce emissions from 
offshore production is evolving, it is 
not yet always economically viable 
for existing offshore facilities. Proven 
technology is being trialled by the 
offshore industry and it is expected 
that significant developments will 
make it more economical for new 
assets by the 2030s and beyond.
Karoon continues to invest in research 
and development that supports 
sustainability initiatives, particularly 
operational efficiency through the 
application of Artificial Intelligence 
(AI) technology. Karoon’s next target 
is to develop Karoon’s Climate 
Transition Action Plan (CTAP) in 2025 
and establish a clear decarbonisation 
pathway for the Company that 
will include existing and emerging 
technology, operational efficiency  
and process improvement, and 
reduction of fugitive emissions.
People and Culture
Karoon’s commitment to People and 
Culture is reflected in our Company 
Mission. We believe that supporting 
the wellbeing of our people, and 
promoting an inclusive and diverse 
culture promotes safety, engagement, 
and productivity. We aim to attract and retain the best people and have 
the right skills and capabilities in 
place to support future work needs. 
Our OneKaroon culture is centred 
upon supporting a thriving workforce 
and our employee programs are 
designed to reflect the needs of all 
employees including the provision  
of flexible working schedules and 
work-life balance programs. 
In 2024, we implemented employee 
programs aimed at supporting 
positive employee engagement, 
reducing turnover, and increasing 
individual accountability to support 
high productivity. 
Diversity and inclusion is a key priority 
for Karoon and is reflected in our 
target of at least 30% participation 
of women on the Board, in Senior 
Leadership positions, and 50% across 
the entire Karoon network. Ensuring 
pay equity and the absence of any 
gender bias in our recruitment and 
remuneration processes is equally  
a significant priority at Karoon.
Community
Karoon remains committed to 
supporting the communities in 
which we operate and on supporting 
gender and social equality, advancing 
education, and fostering positive 
socioeconomic change. 
Under our strategy we have set two 
key commitments. The first is to 
ensure that as the business continues 
to grow, we continue to build and 
improve our community support. THE WAY WE WORK  CONTINUED
