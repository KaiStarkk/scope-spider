Our lost time injury frequency 
rate in FY25 was 1.4 (per million 
hours worked), a reduction from 
2.7 in FY24.  
We remain dedicated to 
continuous improvement, 
listening to our teams, and 
investing in initiatives that 
promote holistic wellbeing.
Inclusion and diversity 
A diverse and inclusive workplace 
is essential to our success. 
During the year, we continued 
implementation of our Inclusion 
and Diversity Plan and became  
a member of Diversity Council 
Australia. This membership 
provides access to research, 
resources, and events across  
a broad spectrum of diversity 
dimensions.
At 30 June 2025, our female 
representation among our 
Non-Executive Directors was 
60%, 33% for our Executive 
Leadership Team, 37% in the 
Leadership Cohort(i) and 36% 
across the whole Group.Environment 
While our environmental footprint 
is relatively small compared to 
many industries, we recognise 
that every organisation has  
a role to play in addressing 
climate change. 
We’re committed to operating 
responsibly and sustainably, 
minimising our impact wherever 
possible. This includes reducing 
energy consumption across our 
operations, supporting renewable 
energy initiatives, and engaging 
our partners in environmentally 
conscious practices. We believe 
that even small actions, when 
taken consistently and 
collectively, contribute 
meaningfully to a more 
sustainable future.
During the year, we made good 
progress in advancing our Net 
Zero Plan and implementing our 
Supplier Carbon Framework. 
These initiatives are central to 
achieving our greenhouse gas 
emissions targets and reflect  
our commitment to reducing  
our environmental impact.Human rights and 
modern slavery 
Modern slavery has no place in 
our operations or supply chain. 
While our business model 
presents a relatively low risk in 
this area, we remain proactive 
and vigilant. 
During the year, we advanced our 
Anti-Slavery Strategy and 
Roadmap, reinforcing our 
commitment to continuous 
improvement in addressing 
modern slavery risks. We 
strengthened our due diligence 
processes, enhanced supplier 
engagement, and continued  
to build awareness across  
our teams. 
We were pleased to receive an ‘A’ 
rating from Monash University for 
the quality of our FY23 Modern 
Slavery Statement, as recognised 
in their report released in 
November 2024(ii). Conclusion
We are proud of the progress 
we’ve made in FY25 against  
our Sustainability Framework,  
as we strive to be a leader in 
sustainability in our industry. 
We remain focused on 
continuous improvement, guided 
by data, dialogue, and a deep 
respect for our stakeholders.
We look forward to keeping you 
informed about our sustainability 
progress and working together  
to shape a future where 
entertainment and responsibility 
go hand in hand.

MATERIALITY CONTINUED
During FY25, we built upon the 
‘pulse check’ double materiality 
assessment initiated in FY24 with 
key internal stakeholders and 
conducted a full double materiality 
assessment process. With the 
assistance of an external consultant, 
this process included assessment 
of a diverse range of data sources, 
and direct engagement with 
internal and external stakeholders, 
to enable a comprehensive 
analysis and determination  
of material topics. Key inputs 
included investor priorities,  
proxy advisor insights, peer and 
competitive analysis benchmarks, 
and industry-wide and Tabcorp-
specific media coverage to offer 
additional contextual insights.
Global industry perspectives, 
particularly on safer gambling, 
enriched the data set, alongside 
findings from two targeted surveys 
(internal and external) and in- 
depth interviews with five key 
stakeholders. 
This multifaceted approach 
provided a balanced and informed 
assessment aligned with 
stakeholder expectations  
and industry trends.
Through a process of engagement 
and analysis we identified eight 
sustainability areas that present  
the most material impacts, risks and 
opportunities to our organisation. 
These areas are displayed as 
‘double material’ in the matrix 
opposite.IMPACT MATERIAL

MATERIALITY CONTINUED
Materiality assessment process
We used the following process to determine materiality:
 SCOPE SETTINGWe set our objectives and goals for the assessment, and continued to use the double 
materiality approach to also consider our impact
  TOPIC MAPPINGWe reviewed industry specific sustainability topics, and the long list of sustainability issues 
created in our initial assessment that could be potentially material to our business
  STAKEHOLDER MAPPINGWe created groups for our key internal and external stakeholders, gave each group  
a weighting, and then added individual stakeholders to the groups
  STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENTWe built upon the results of our internal stakeholder engagement in FY24 with a secondary 
survey for both internal and external stakeholders. We then conducted in-depth interviews 
with five selected stakeholders to capture the issues they see as material
  ANALYSIS We analysed stakeholder survey results and feedback received during the interviews  
to identify topics considered material
  MATERIALITY THRESHOLDSBased on internal discussions, we set preliminary materiality thresholds for impact materiality 
and financial materiality at 75 (based on a normalised scale of 0 to 100). If a sustainability 
matter scores 75 points or more it crosses our threshold
  VALIDATIONWe validated each topic score through an internal discussion, focusing on both score and 
qualitative insights. Some topics crossed our preliminary materiality thresholds but were 
ultimately determined to be not material, whereas other topics scoring below the preliminary 
thresholds were deemed to be material. For instance, both GHG and climate topics were 
determined to be financially material with Australia’s new climate-related financial disclosure 
regime, effective from FY26
  SELECTION AND ANALYSISWe selected topics deemed material through stakeholder engagement and internal analysis 
and aligned the material topics with the UN SDGs
  APPROVALThe sustainability topics identified and validated as material were presented to our 
Leadership team and Board for consideration and endorsement1
