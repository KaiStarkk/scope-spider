Message from our Chair and CEO
Our 2025 Sustainability Report provides an update on the progress 
and achie
vements made throughout the year on our FY25 - FY28 
Sustainability Strategy.
Sustainability is an important component of the McMillan 
Shak
espeare Group (MMS) strategy and aligns with our 
purpose of making a positive difference to people’s lives.
We are proud to help over 500,000 Australians as their 
trus
ted partner with simple, tailored solutions to access 
the benefits  of salary packaging, novated leasing, fleet 
management and National Disability Insurance Scheme 
(NDIS) plans
. Our salary packaging and novated leasing 
services remain essential for Australians, helping them 
manage their financial  pressures gaining more affordable 
access to vehicles.
During the year, we continued to deliver on our sustainability 
s
trategy which was introduced in FY21 and updated for 
the FY25 – FY28 period, to provide a clear framework for 
driving positive environmental and social outcomes for our 
stakeholders and communities in which we operate. We 
supported our customers to continue their transition 
to a low carbon economy, reduced our environmental 
impact, prepared for incoming mandatory climate-related 
disclosures and made a positive difference to our customers 
and communities.
L o w c arbon futur e
During FY25 we continued to provide education and tools 
to help our cus
tomers make sustainable decisions when 
reviewing their fleet  requirements or novated lease options.
Vehicle emission intensity ratings are included in all 
quotations f
or passenger and light commercial vehicles 
and environmental performance reports are provided to 
fleet  customers.Our customers can access tools such as ‘On the Go’ EV 
char
ge cards, giving them the flexibility to charge up at 
o
ver 300 locations across Australia. Our fleet customers can 
also tak
e advantage of beneficial  finance  for low and zero 
emission vehicles through our finance partners. Our novated 
lease cus
tomers can benefit  from our partnerships with 
access to savings on home electric vehicle (EV) charging 
solutions. We continue to work with both Greenfleet and 
Ampol to of
fer carbon offsetting options for customers.
During the year we continued to focus on reducing 
gr
eenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with direct 
scope 1 (fuel use) and scope 2 (purchased electricity) 
emissions. We saw a reduction in the measured scope 1 
and scope 2 net emissions of 16% from prior year. These 
reductions reflect our transition to renewable electricity 
(in offices  where we can select the energy retailer) and 
transitioning 54% of our fleet to battery electric vehicles 
(E
Vs). Our FY25 GHG emissions reporting is aligned with 
the requirements of the Australian Sustainability Reporting 
Standard AASB S2 Climate-related Disclosures (AASB 
S2) for entities to report their scope 1 and 2 emissions 
and obtain Limited Assurance over these disclosure 
requirements. For the second consecutive year MMS has 
obtained independent Limited Assurance for its scope 1 and 
scope 2 GHG emissions reporting.
Social impac t
Seeking to create better outcomes for our customers and 
the communit
y is what we do every day aligned with our 
purpose of making a positive difference to people's lives.
This year we continued our partnership with Jigsaw 
Aus
tralia which since 2023 has seen eight Jigsaw trainees

R i s k  c u l t u r e
The MMS Board recognises that sound risk management 
is a continual pr
ocess which is an integral component of 
good corporate governance and fundamental to the Group 
fulfilling  its purpose, achieving its strategic objectives and 
maintaining its social license to operate.  MMS maintains a 
Risk Management Framework (Framework) that is based on 
the guidelines set out in ISO 31000:2018 which provides 
for a structured and comprehensive approach to identify, 
analyse, evaluate, treat, record and report material risks to 
the Group’s strategic and operational objectives.
MMS strives to promote and foster an organisational culture 
that is risk aw
are and which is supported by high standards 
of accountability where employees understand and adhere 
to their responsibilities for managing risks within the 
parameters of the Board’s risk appetite and internal policies.In FY25 MMS commenced implementation of a digitised 
Go
vernance, Risk and Compliance platform, partnering 
with an external company to embed an end-to-end 
enterprise-wide risk management technology solution 
across the Group. The platform will further enhance 
MMS’ risk management processes. The platform will 
allow for management and reporting of identified climate-
r
elated risks and opportunities and automate reporting 
against environmental targets including reporting of MMS’ 
greenhouse gas emissions.
In recognition of the increasing opportunities that AI 
pr
esents to MMS i.e. to enrich customer experience, 
provide operational efficiencies, improve quality and risk 
management
, during the year the Group established its 
Responsible AI Policy and Governance Framework to 
inform and guide our approach to the responsible design, 
development and use of AI systems.
Advocating for better outcomes
We proactively participate in and advocate for public policy 
r
eforms that have the potential to impact our business, 
industry and customers, primarily through the industry 
organisations that MMS is a member of.
The Group’s public policy advocacy work throughout FY25 
r
elated to matters concerning:
–Australia’s transition to zero emission vehicles and de-
carbonisation of land tr
ansport and associated taxation 
and policy arrangements.
–The Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) regime as it relates to 
electric v
ehicles and chargers.
–Regulatory requirements pertaining to products and 
ser
vices provided by the Group.
–Through our association with AFIA we submitted 
f
eedback on the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-
Terrorism Financing Amendment legislative review and 
the Proposals paper for introducing mandatory guardrails 
for AI in high-risk settings.
–Senate Select Committee on the Cost of Living 
specifically regarding novated leasing and salary 
pack
aging measures.
–Climate Change, Energy, Environment and Water enquiry 
into the tr
ansition to electric vehicles.
–NDIS reforms and NDIS pricing changes via engagement 
with the Agency and Go
vernment.
