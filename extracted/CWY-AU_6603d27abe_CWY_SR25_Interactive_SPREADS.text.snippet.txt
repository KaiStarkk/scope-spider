FOREWORD FROM CEO
We play an important 
role enabling Australia’s 
evolving circular economy 
and helping our customers 
protect the environment,  
delivering outcomes that 
support a sustainable 
future for all.MAKING A 
SUSTAINABLE 
FUTURE  
POSSIBLE  
TOGETHER

  At Cleanaway, our people and 
communities are at the heart of 
our purpose: making a sustainable 
future possible together. Because 
in a sustainable future, people 
thrive, the environment is 
protected, and resources are 
used wisely. This report provides 
an update on our progress in 
strengthening and expanding our 
positive environmental and social 
impact over the past 12 months.
Our FY25 safety performance reflects both the 
challenges and progress of implementing our 
comprehensive five-year Health, Safety and Environment 
(HSE) Strategy. I am deeply disappointed to report that 
we experienced three fatalities in our operations during 
the period. On behalf of the Board and Management 
team, we extend our deepest sympathies to the 
families, friends and colleagues affected by these tragic 
events. The health, safety and wellbeing of every single 
member of the Cleanaway team and our contractors is 
fundamental to how we work and these events weighed 
heavily on all of us. 
Two of the fatalities involved driving which remains 
our biggest risk given both the size of our fleet and 
the number of kilometres we drive. As a result, we 
challenged our plans to see whether we could further 
accelerate key elements related to safe driving. We 
will roll-out in-vehicle monitoring systems (IVMS) across 
the fleet during FY26 to promote safer driving and we 
have further accelerated our fleet replacement program 
to ensure our vehicles are equipped with the latest 
safety systems.
Investing in our ability to make a 
sustainable future possible together 
A highlight of FY25 has been our progress in building 
a culture of respect, critical to safely and effectively 
working together with our stakeholders. We reinforced 
our commitment to this journey in February 2025 with 
the launch of Respect 2.0 which has delivered a range 
of training, communication and leadership initiatives.
This was supported by continued engagement with our 
five Guiding Principles and the expansion of our Stronger 
Together safety training to leaders deeper within the 
organisation, who are key to enabling this cultural shift.I’m proud to report we met our net Scope 1 and 2 
emissions reduction target this year and remain on track 
to achieve our 2030 net Scope 1 and 2 emissions targets 
on both methane and a combined GHG basis.
We completed our first Scope 3 emissions assessment, 
reflecting our commitment to climate accountability and 
decarbonisation. Our Scope 3 emissions were estimated 
at 484kt CO2-e, around 30% of our total footprint, with 
key contributors being fuel, transport, landfill use and 
heavy vehicle purchases. Addressing these will take time, 
but this assessment provides a strong foundation for 
future action.
Reflecting our focus and commitment to diversity, 
equity and inclusion, we saw an increase in our overall 
and operational female participation rates. We also 
launched our Innovate Reconciliation Action Plan 
(RAP) 2025 – 2027 in June 2025, and introduced our 
social enterprise and post-incarceration employment 
pathways programs. 
We continued to invest in our ability to increase our 
impact through capacity, innovation and acquisitions. 
In Sydney, our largest metropolitan market, we 
expanded our resource recovery capacity with the 
commissioning of our new material recovery facility 
(MRF) at Rooty Hill and increased food organics and 
garden organics (FOGO) processing at our organics 
processing facility in Eastern Creek. In Melbourne, 
as part of our acquisition of Citywide Services’ waste 
and recycling assets (known as Citywide Waste), we 
have committed to redevelop the Dynon Road, West 
Melbourne transfer station into a state -of-the-art 
facility with double its current capacity. Our partnership 
with Viva Energy is progressing a hard -to-recycle soft 
plastics solution, while the acquisition of Contract 
Resources enhances our capability to manage 
complex waste streams arising from the growing 
decommissioning, decontamination and remediation 
needs of the energy sector. Looking ahead, we remain 
committed to driving sustainable outcomes for 
our customers. 
Thank you to the Cleanaway team, who every day, 
by working with our customers and communities, 
are Making a sustainable future possible together .
