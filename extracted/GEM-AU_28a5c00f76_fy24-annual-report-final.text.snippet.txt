Pillar: Our EnvironmentOUR ENVIRONMENT
G8 Education is committed to reducing its environmental footprint and fostering a sustainable future for generations to 
come. We demonstrate this commitment by: 
• Continuing our investment in solar and green energy 
• Disclosing and reporting Scope 1 and Scope 2 emission targets aligned with a 1.5 degree Paris Agreement scenario 
• Taking steps to be ready to measure Scope 3 emissions in compliance with ASRS standards
• Role modelling, teaching and promoting awareness of environment in children through daily practices, resources and 
educational opportunities 
• Engaging in recycling initiatives. 
In 2024 we continued our progress on reducing emissions, transitioning to renewable energy and educating children 
about environmental stewardship. These initiatives align with our support of the goal of the Paris Agreement to limit 
global warming and our role in preparing the next generation for a sustainable future.

in Learning 
Environmental education is 
embedded in our centres’ 
daily practices and resources. 
Through interactive programs, 
we aim to model lifelong 
environmental values, fostering 
awareness and stewardship. 
Our educators engage children 
in sustainability activities, such 
as recycling and conservation, 
creating a foundation for future 
eco-conscious behaviours.

The G8 Education Board oversees climate-related risks and opportunities, delegating 
this responsibility to the Audit & Risk Management Committee. Senior leadership 
manages these risks and opportunities, reporting progress on sustainability targets 
and climate related initiatives. 
Climate change presents risks and opportunities for G8 Education. Physical risks, 
including flooding and bushfires, disrupt centre operations, damage facilities, 
and increase energy demands to maintain comfortable environments in rising 
temperatures. Transition risks involve higher grid energy costs, evolving compliance 
requirements, and reputational impacts. However, climate action also presents 
opportunities, such as lowering operating costs, enhancing organisational resilience 
and attracting environmentally conscious team members, families and investors. For 
example, our solar rollout program not only reduces reliance on grid electricity but 
also decreases energy costs while reinforcing our commitment to sustainability.
Our prior investment in solar has contributed to a reduction in Scope 1 and 
Scope 2 emissions by >10% for our second consecutive year in 2024, surpassing our 
4.2% annual reduction target aligned with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5-degree Celsius 
scenario. In light of this, we have raised our reduction target to 6% annually and are 
extending our solar rollout project into 2025.
We also renewed our sustainability linked loan in 2024, with emissions reduction 
set as a key performance target. Linking our emissions reductions targets to our 
sustainability linked loan ensures robust data collection and annual assurance, 
improving the accountability and transparency of our climate initiatives.>14%
