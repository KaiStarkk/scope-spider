Reporting Scope and Boundaries
Macmahon assesses its obligations under the 
National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007 
(Cth) on an annual basis. This includes determining 
whether the Group exceeds any reporting thresholds 
for Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, energy 
consumption, or energy production within Australia, 
based on operational control. Macmahon did not 
exceed any reporting thresholds for mandatory 
reporting in FY25.
Macmahon has defined its reporting boundaries 
in accordance with the NGER framework. This 
assessment includes facilities where Macmahon has 
operational control, including selected project sites 
and corporate facilities, within Australia only.
The FY25 reporting boundary includes:
• Scope 1: Emissions and energy consumption from 
fuels, explosives, and hydrocarbons purchased  
and used
• Scope 2: Emissions and energy consumption from 
electricity purchased and used
During FY25, Macmahon commenced work to define 
its Scope 3 boundaries and begin establishing a 
baseline. This activity remains in progress, with initial 
boundary-setting and data mapping well progressed, 
and further refinement planned in FY26.

FY25 Performance
Continued work to enhance the availability 
and accuracy of Scope 1 and 2 emissions 
data across all Macmahon entities.
Initiated an external review to assess 
assurance readiness for future climate-
related disclosures.
Progressed the definition of Scope 3 
boundaries and mapped key data sources.
Re-evaluated the existing ESG roadmap  
to align with AASB S2 reporting 
requirements, which comes into effect  
in FY26.
Assessed climate risk and opportunity 
frameworks to support enterprise  
risk management.
Climate Adaptation, Resilience 
and Transition
Macmahon continues to monitor and report 
Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions to improve visibility 
of our operational impacts and strengthen 
alignment with emerging requirements under 
AASB S2.
Climate Change
Macmahon recognises the operational and 
strategic risks posed by climate change and 
the increasing need to support a low-carbon 
economy. We are working to reduce our 
emissions footprint by improving data quality, 
identifying energy efficiency opportunities, and 
collaborating with clients on decarbonisation 
efforts. As a contractor to critical mineral and 
infrastructure projects, we also contribute to the 
global energy transition.Zero environmental prosecutions or 
infringements made against Macmahon.

Scope 1 and 2 Emissions
Scope 1: 9,30 1 t CO2-e
*Scope 1 refers to direct GHG emissions and 
associated energy consumption from activities 
under Macmahon’s operational control.
TABLE 1: GHG EMISSIONS AND ENERGY UNDER MACMAHON'S OPERATIONAL CONTROL
UNIT FY25 FY24* FY23*
GHG emissions - Scope 1 t CO2-e 9,301 894 1,091
GHG emissions - Scope 2 t CO2-e 3,203 977 913
Total GHG emissions (Scope 1 and 2) t CO2-e 12,504 1,871 2,004
Energy consumed GJ 155,422 19,726 22,148
*Note: Emissions and energy from previous reporting periods are from Macmahon’s previously reported totals and does not include 
activities associated with Decmil. As a principal contractor, Decmil may periodically assume operational control, consistent with 
industry practice where clients delegate day-to-day management and operational authority during the construction phase.
Climate Strategy
Macmahon’s direct GHG emissions and energy 
use are closely tied to the number and type of 
projects where we hold operational control. In 
the civil and infrastructure sector, this control is 
typically more variable due to shorter project 
durations and differing contractual responsibilities 
compared to mining projects. To respond, 
we have focused on improving data quality, 
clarifying emissions boundaries, and identifying 
opportunities for efficiency at sites where we hold 
operational control.
Macmahon also recognises the importance of 
understanding and addressing indirect  (Scope 3) GHG emissions. This includes engaging 
with clients and suppliers to identify opportunities for 
carbon reduction across project delivery. 
One example is our participation in Caterpillar’s 
Pathways to Sustainability’ program. 
Climate-related emissions targets will be considered 
as part of Macmahon’s broader approach to 
emissions management, following completion  
of Group-wide Scope 1, 2 and 3 baseline assessments, 
including those arising from the integration of Decmil.GHG Emissions and Energy
In FY25, we completed a review of our GHG 
emissions reporting boundaries and calculation 
methodology to ensure alignment across the 
Group following the acquisition of Decmil and 
internal business restructuring, and to meet 
evolving reporting requirements.
We report Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions 
and energy consumed from Australian activities 
under our operational control, as defined by the 
NGER framework , or otherwise accepted through 
contractual obligations. The Decmil acquisition led to a notable increase 
in Macmahon’s GHG emissions and energy use 
in FY25, primarily due to operational control of 
several civil and infrastructure projects.
Despite this increase, Macmahon did not meet 
the thresholds for mandatory reporting under the 
National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 
2007 (Cth) in FY25.
All data was internally verified by management.
Scope 2: 3,203 t CO2-e
*Scope 2 refers to indirect GHG emissions and 
associated energy consumption from electricity 
purchased and used at facilities under Macmahon’s 
operational control.
