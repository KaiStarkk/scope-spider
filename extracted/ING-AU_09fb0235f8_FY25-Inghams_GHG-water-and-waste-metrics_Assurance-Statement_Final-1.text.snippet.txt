INDEPENDENT ASSURANCE STATEMENT 
 
 
To the Stakeholders of Ingham’s Group Ltd (Ingham’s) 
 
 
Limited Assurance Conclusion 
Based on the procedures performed and evidence obtained, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe the water related metrics (“Subject 
Matter Information”), including associated methods, assumptions, and estimation uncertainty, presented in Ingham’s Annual Report 2025 (“the Report”), 
are not fairly presented and prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria, within the scope of our limited assurance 
engagement (as outlined below). 
 
Scope of the Assurance Engagement  
The scope of assurance was limited to the Subject Matter Information, as presented in the table below and within the Report, applicable to facilities under 
Ingham’s operational control (breeder farms, broiler farms, feed mill, hatcheries, primary/further processing sites, distribution centres, administration offices) 
in Australia and New Zealand for the period of 30th June 2024 to 28th June 2025 (Ingham’s own financial year of 2025).

Our assurance engagement does not extend to any other information included in the Report or information from earlier periods. We have not performed 
any procedures on the excluded information and, therefore, do not express any conclusion on it.

(2015) issued by the World Resources Institute (WRI) and the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), and Inghams’ internal 
document - “Sustainability Reporting Basis of Preparation FY2025” dated May 2025.
