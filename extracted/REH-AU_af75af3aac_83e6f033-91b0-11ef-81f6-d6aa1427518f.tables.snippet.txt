1. About this report
The sustainability report covers Reece Limited (‘the Group’ or ‘Reece’) and controlled entities as a Group. This report aims
to summarise Reece Limited and its subsidiary companies’ performance and approach to sustainability in the year ended 30
June 2024. The Group has reported the information cited in this report with reference to the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)
standards. Our carbon emissions are aligned with the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol for carbon emission reporting. This
"report should be read alongside our suite of reporting documents, including our 2024 Annual Report, Corporate Governance"
"Statement, Modern Slavery Statement and related sustainability reporting available on the Reece Group website."
The Group’s segments are based on the geographical operation of the business and comprise Australia and New Zealand (ANZ)
"and the United States of America (US). Reece Group is a distributor of plumbing, waterworks, bathroom and kitchen, and HVAC-R"
"(heating, ventilation, air conditioning and refrigeration) products. These products are consistent in both geographic locations."
2. Future developments in sustainability reporting
"In September 2024, the Australian Government passed a bill to mandate climate-related financial disclosures and the Australian"
Accounting Standards Board (AASB) is developing Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards (ASRS) for entities to meet the
new requirements. These standards are expected to be aligned with the IFRS Sustainability Reporting Standards and require
"disclosures under four key pillars: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. The Australian standards"
(AASB S1 and S2) will apply to the Group from the financial year ended 30 June 2026.
We have set up a sustainability reporting transformation team encompassing cross-disciplined teams to work towards FY26
"mandatory sustainability reporting. During FY24, we have performed a gap analysis against the incoming sustainability reporting"
standards and have made headway closing gaps in preparation for FY26. We also undertook a detailed analysis of our
sustainability risks and opportunities across the Group. We completed a range of engagements across our business to identify
"risks and opportunities and, with the help of an external consultant, conducted further analysis and modelling on the impact of"
these to our business under various temperature and timeframe scenarios. We are currently reviewing our key climate-related risks
and opportunities to assist us to understand and take action to strengthen our climate resilience.
Scope 3 GHG emissions
In FY23 we began a process to quantify our Scope 3 emissions by determining our measurement approach in alignment with the
"GHG protocol. In FY24 we assessed the Scope 3 emissions for our Australia region, and we will now expand this assessment to"
cover NZ and the US. These disclosures will be aligned to the AASB requirements and disclosed in FY27.

4.8 Reducing our carbon footprint
"In FY24, the Group’s Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions were 63,996 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e-),"
"calculated on market-based methodology to reflect our use of renewable energy. This represents a 2.4% decrease on FY23,"
and a 0.2% decrease on our FY21 baseline.
"Across the Group, we grew our network by 2% in FY24. Fuel use was flat compared to the prior year, as kilometres travelled"
"by our fleet remained consistent with FY23. Our electricity consumption was also flat year on year, while we realised a"
benefit upon conversion to tCO2e- due to the broader decarbonisation of the grid.
The tables below outline Reece’s decarbonisation performance data since our baseline year.
