A message from our Chief Executive Officer 
and our Chief Risk Officer
Since our establishment as a trustee 
company nearly 140 years ago, Perpetual 
has maintained a commitment to 
acting in the best interests of our 
clients and the communities we 
support to ensure a positive impact 
and help build a sustainable future. 
Built upon our core values of excellence, 
integrity and partnership, our purpose 
is to create enduring prosperity 
and we have continually evolved to 
meet the challenges of economic, 
technological and social change. In September 2022, Perpetual introduced its 
Prosperity Plan  – our comprehensive sustainability 
strategy. This report marks our final performance 
update as we transition to a new strategy in the coming 
year. The strategy’s four pillars included 35 commitments 
of which 23 are currently on track or have been 
successfully achieved.
While there is still work to be done, the results achieved 
to date coincide with a period of significant change and 
uncertainty across our business. Despite this, we have 
demonstrated resilience and adaptability, enabling us to 
deliver 65% of our commitments and make meaningful 
progress on several key initiatives; with greater clarity 
on the renewed pathway ahead. 
We delivered 65% of our commitments 
and made meaningful progress 
on several key initiatives.Planet: Measuring our impact on the environment
We are committed to reducing our operational 
environmental footprint. We have procured renewable 
energy for each of our global offices and continued 
reporting on our operational GHG emissions and our 
financed emissions.
Perpetual Group has a climate roadmap in place to 
prepare for the Australian mandatory climate disclosures – 
Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards (ASRS) and 
we have a cross-functional working group to coordinate 
our efforts across the Group. We have commenced work 
on climate scenario analysis, scoping for relevant limited 
assurance and engagement with appropriate business 
stakeholders for integration into processes and financial 
disclosures to ensure we are ready for ASRS reporting 
in FY26.
People: Championing inclusion and high performance
While Perpetual remains committed to building better 
gender diversity in our business, we did not meet our 
targets for women in leadership (40%) and women in asset 
management (25%). Our progress in these areas has been 
significantly affected by the transition to a new operating 
model. As leaders, this moment calls for reflection – we 
acknowledge that improvement is necessary, and we 
recognise that there is still considerable work ahead.
We remain firmly committed to advancing gender equity. 
With the rollout of our new operating model, we are 
introducing a refreshed Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
(DEI) strategy for FY26–28 in Australia. Our gender 
representation goals will continue to be a central focus 
moving forward.4

Grow our products and services that support 
a low carbon future
Perpetual Group has committed to grow our products 
and services that support a low carbon future1. 
In FY25, funds that we define as supporting a low carbon 
future had $1.03 billion outflows, which is not in line with 
our commitment to grow this part of our business2.
Since establishing this commitment, the funds captured 
within this category have been under added stress from 
the politicisation of ESG. The core set of funds that was 
defined as supporting a low carbon future were those 
managed by boutique, Trillium Asset Management. 
A decision has been made to work towards a more 
appropriate target overlay that best fits our investment 
strategies after more work is completed on our 
transition plan under AASB S2.Carbon neutral operations
We were able to achieve our goal of "Carbon neutral 
operations by FY23". This was achieved through 
carbon offsetting operational emissions and through 
the completion of two years of voluntary reporting 
(FY23 and FY24) to the Climate Active Carbon Neutral 
certification program. 
Perpetual made the decision to end offsetting 
operational emissions and voluntary reporting in 
January 2025, shifting our focus on mandatory 
reporting preparation for AASB S2.
Reduce paper purchased for printing in 
Australian offices3
As of 30 June 2025, we purchased 5.32 tonnes of 
paper for the year, which was a 41% reduction of paper 
purchased in Australian offices. This is unfortunately 
over our target of 4.5 tonnes, which would have seen a 
50% reduction4. The extended Strategic Review process 
has impacted the ability to achieve material change within 
those areas of heavy use over the year.
1. We measure this by growth of funds, in terms of net flows, rather than new product launches or change in assets under management, which is impacted by market movements.
2. Our definition of funds that support a low carbon future includes Trillium’s larger cap ‑equity strategies, which are subject to an interim target for 75% of the holdings to commit to set science ‑based targets for reducing their 
GHG emissions, as approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative, by the end of 2030. Perpetual Group has other sustainability ‑orientated investment strategies with low carbon characteristics, including those with fossil 
fuel screens, which are not included in the definition of funds that support a low carbon future.
3. This commitment had been de ‑prioritised during the FY25 period due to extensive separation changes.
4. FY21 baseline.A decision has been made to review 
existing commitments as we progress in 
developing a new sustainability strategy

As a large business operating in Australia, Perpetual 
Group will be subject to the ASRS and will be required 
to make additional climate-related disclosures from 
FY26. Perpetual Group has a climate roadmap in place to 
prepare for the Australian mandatory climate disclosures 
and we have a cross-functional working group to 
coordinate our efforts across the Group.
Governance 
Our Board oversees our sustainability strategy and 
climate-related issues. Since the implementation of 
Perpetual’s Prosperity Plan,  we have made governance 
improvements to enhance this oversight. This includes 
explicitly referencing the Board’s role in managing 
climate-related risks in the Board Charter. Sustainability 
and responsible investment now sits within the Board 
skills matrix, which outlines the key skills and experience 
we aim to achieve, now including climate change. 
Our sustainability governance structure  ensures 
sustainability is integrated and supported throughout 
all levels of our organisation.
The Sustainability team provides the Board and ExCo 
with six-monthly updates on climate and our sustainability 
strategy. These updates include a status report on our 
climate-related commitments, metrics related to our 
operational performance, and climate risk and emissions 
exposure metrics for our investments.
This year, executive remuneration was covered by 
the sustainability overlay. It was directly linked to the 
35 sustainability commitments, meaning it has broader 
alignment to AASB S1 factors such as people, community 
and governance. The climate-linked commitments 
are outlined in the commitments section on  
page 16 . As work progresses in FY26 around climate 
risk and opportunities, the overlay may begin to 
introduce more focused climate-related considerations.We established the Climate Disclosure Working Group 
to our governance structure, with the intended purpose 
of bringing together the right people to support 
mandatory disclosure under AASB S2 and drive climate 
risk and opportunities integration across all levels 
of the organisation. This group met throughout the 
year to review progress at a Group and business unit 
level, with the core focus on the Group level being a 
year 1 reporting entity. 
During the year, further sustainability roles were scoped 
and hired for in the underlying business units to support 
deeper governance and accountability for addressing 
climate and broader sustainability. These roles aim 
to enhance the understanding and implementation 
of climate and sustainability linked strategies in 
Corporate Trust and Wealth Management. 
Strategy and risk management
Over the long term, the transition to a lower carbon 
economy will require significant amounts of public and 
private capital, creating risks for high emitting industries 
and opportunities for transition-aligned technologies. 
However, this path is unlikely to be linear, and the scale 
and pace of change required for this transformation is 
leading to economic, social and political tensions that can 
create volatility in financial markets. In this context, active 
managers have a role to play helping clients to navigate 
the shifting risks and opportunities of this transition.
The identification, assessment and management of 
climate risk is integrated into our enterprise-wide risk 
management processes. Climate-related risks are 
reflected in the Sustainability and Responsible Investing 
risk category within our RMF. The RMF is in place to ensure 
risks are identified, assessed and managed effectively 
across the Group.Described in the table on the next page  are the 
inherent climate risks identified in the assessment and 
examples of some of the risk mitigants in place at the 
Group level, tailored to the local risk environments for 
those businesses.
This year, we sought the assistance of an industry partner 
to conduct scenario analysis over Perpetual’s strategic 
business model, operations and investment portfolios. 
The intention of this project is to enable guidance 
on strategic decision making and investment team 
engagement to manage risks and advance opportunities 
relating to climate change. In late FY25, we appointed 
Alvarez & Marsal (A&M) to support this endeavour, 
and we will be able to share more detailed information 
of the outputs on this project in our next report.Mandatory Climate Disclosure – meeting AASB S2
