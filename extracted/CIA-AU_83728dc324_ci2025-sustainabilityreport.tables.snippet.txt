GHG Reporting,
Our  GHG  intensity  per  tonne  of  iron  ore  produced  slightly  increased  from  8.95  kg  of,"Benefiting from access to renewable hydroelectricity, our Company ranks as a global"
,
CO2e  to  9.06  during  the  reporting  period.  The  increase  in  our  energy  consumption,leader in scope 1 and 2 emission intensity per tonne of high-grade iron ore produced.
and GHG intensity is primarily due to a higher volume of material moved in our mining,
"operations  and  processes.  Last  year,  we  transported  a  total  of  65.8  Mt,  comprising",
,"In FY2025, a total of 124,118 tonnes of CO2e were emitted from Scope 1 direct sources"
"40.9 Mt of ore and 24.9 Mt of waste rock. This year, while ore volumes remained stable",
,"(99%) while 1,171 tonnes of CO2e originated from Scope 2 indirect hydroelectric sources"
"at 39.9 Mt, waste rock haulage increased by nearly 50% to 36.6 Mt, bringing the total",(1%). All our GHG emissions fall under the Québec regulations and the cap-and-trade
"material moved to 76.5 Mt, an overall increase of 16%.","system, however, a portion of it is directly managed by suppliers as per legislation. Our"
,"emissions, in absolute terms, are listed in the following table."
"Despite  this  increase  in  mining  activity,  our  GHG  emissions  decreased  by  1.2%.  This",
decoupling of emissions from material movement underscores the impact of our GHG,
