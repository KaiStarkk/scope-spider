Reference,Description
Natural Capital,"The stock of renewable and non-renewable natural resources (e.g., plants, animals, air, water, soils, minerals) that combine to yield a flow of benefits to people."
Natural Capital Accounting,"Natural capital accounting involves measuring, quantifying, and valuing the natural assets—resources and ecosystems—that form the foundation of both society and the environment. These natural"
,"assets, such as the flora and fauna in forests, grasslands, and oceans, as well as the clean water and air in rivers and the atmosphere, provide a broad range of essential ecosystem services. These"
,"services support critical functions like food and raw material provision, climate regulation, water purification, soil formation, nutrient cycling, and cultural benefits such as recreation and education."
,"They are vital to ecological balance and human well-being, yet they are often overlooked in traditional economic assessments. Natural capital accounting bridges this gap by quantifying and valuing"
,"these assets and services, helping to highlight their true importance and guide more sustainable natural resource management."
,The process of natural capital accounting follows five key steps:
,"1) 
Identify and assess the condition of natural capital assets relevant to a business or region. Establishing a baseline is essential for tracking changes over time."
,"2)  Measure the quantity of these assets or the ecosystem services they provide, to determine whether natural capital is being maintained, enhanced, or depleted."
,"3)  Assign value to these assets and services, considering both economic and non-economic factors, such as cultural significance or biodiversity value."
,"4) 
Implement systems and metrics to monitor and track changes over time. By monitoring these assets and services, we can more effectively understand and manage the resource."
,"5) 
Involve local communities, especially Indigenous peoples, in the process. Their deep connection to the land and sustainable practices are critical to ensuring that our efforts are both sound"
,and respectful.
Nature,"Nature is both the abiotic (non-living) and biotic (living) environment – climate, land, freshwater, ocean, and biodiversity (of which people are a part)."
Nature Positive,"A nature-positive future means that we, as a global society, halt and reverse the loss of nature measured from its current status, reducing future negative impacts alongside restoring and renewing"
,"nature, to put both living and non-living nature measurably on the path to recovery."
Nature Roadmap,"A Nature Roadmap refers to a strategic plan or framework that outlines an organisation’s approach to addressing its environmental impacts, dependencies, and responsibilities related to natural"
,"resources and ecosystems. It typically includes specific actions, milestones, and timelines aimed at enhancing sustainability, protecting biodiversity, and achieving positive outcomes for nature."
,"The roadmap may cover areas such as resource management, biodiversity protection, climate resilience, and compliance with environmental regulations. It serves as a guide for decision-making,"
,so that the organisation systematically and transparently advances its nature-related goals.
Net Zero Plan,GPT’s Net Zero Plan is our comprehensive approach to climate change. It could also be referred to as a Climate Transition Plan or Climate Transition Action Plan. The plan aims to reduce GHG
,"emissions (Scope 1 and 2), transition to a low carbon economy, and foster business resilience in various climate scenarios."
Operational control,"Operational control is where an entity has principal decision making authority in respect of operating a space or a service. For example, GPT does not have operational control over the majority of"
,"its logistics assets, where tenants have principal decision making authority over matters such as entry into contracts for the supply of energy and its use on site. GPT has operational control of base"
,building energy and emissions in office and retail assets and does not have operational control over energy and emissions in logistics assets.
Paris Agreement,"The Paris Agreement is an international treaty on climate change adopted by 196 Parties at COP 21 in Paris, on 12 December 2015, and entered into force on 4 November 2016. Its goal is to limit global"
,"warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius, compared to pre-industrial levels. The Agreement aims to achieve this through nationally determined contributions (NDCs),"
,which are voluntary commitments from each country to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Physical risks,"Physical risks are a direct result of an organisation’s dependencies on nature. These are risks arising when natural systems are compromised, due to the impact of climatic events (e.g. extreme"
,"weather such as a drought), geologic events (e.g. seismic events such as an earthquake) or changes in ecosystem equilibria, such as changes in soil quality or ocean chemistry. These can be acute,"
,chronic or both.
Ramsar wetlands,"A Ramsar site is a wetland area designated under the Ramsar Convention, an international treaty for the conservation and sustainable use of wetlands. In Australia, Ramsar sites are protected"
,"under both national legislation (the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 or EPBC Act) and state legislation, ensuring their conservation and sustainable management."
Renewable Electricity,"Renewable electricity refers to electricity generated from renewable energy sources that are naturally replenished on a human timescale. These sources include solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal,"
,"and biomass energy. Unlike fossil fuels, renewable energy sources do not deplete over time and typically have a much lower environmental impact, making them key to reducing greenhouse gas"
,emissions and combating climate change.
Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs),"RCPs are different GHG concentrations and their radiative forcing potential to describe different climate futures that are considered in scenario analysis, and have been formally adopted by the IPCC."
