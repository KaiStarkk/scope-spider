Over the past financial 
year, GWA has continued 
to demonstrate consistent 
commitment to driving 
sustainable business outcomes, 
whilst achieving business 
growth in a challenging market 
and delivering lasting value to 
key stakeholders. 
GWA’s performance is a testament to the 
commitment to integrate sustainable and 
responsible practices within business operations 
and across the value chain. We recognise that 
driving change requires collaboration and 
relationship building with stakeholders including 
employees, customers, plumbers, merchants, 
suppliers and community members. 
In FY2025, we continued to reduce emissions 
from our global vehicle fleet through the 
ongoing transition to hybrid electric vehicles, 
and trialled rail freight in our efforts to minimise 
carbon emissions. Pleasingly, we saw a reduction 
in electricity consumption in FY2025, which 
resulted in an 18% decrease in Scope 2 emissions 
compared with FY2024. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
FROM THE CHAIR & MANAGING DIRECTORWe enhanced our social impact by  
implementing initiatives that benefit our 
employees, customers and communities.  
Our commitment to supporting non-profit  
and community organisations has also remained 
strong, with a notable highlight being our newly 
formed association with Habitat for Humanity. 
By adopting agile work practices, we fostered 
strong cross-team collaboration which delivered 
improved outcomes across a range of strategic 
initiatives and customer interactions. 
Governance continues to be a top priority for 
GWA. Key initiatives undertaken include the 
implementation of a refreshed and expanded 
Enterprise Risk Management Framework,  
which is used to monitor business activities 
within the context of the Board endorsed Risk 
Appetite Statement.
We are proud to have obtained ISO 9001:2015  
certification for quality management and  
ISO 14001:2015 certification for environmental 
management, across product design and supply, 
showcasing GWA’s commitment towards  
driving product stewardship across the value 
chain. Additionally, GWA maintained its  
ISO 45001:2018 certification for its occupational 
health and safety management system. 
We are proud of our efforts in FY2025 and the 
progress made on GWA’s ESG Roadmap, and 
will continue to focus on improvement to deliver 
lasting value to our customers, employees and 
the community.

WASTE DIVERTED FROM DISPOSAL
In FY2025, GWA recycled 52% of its operational 
waste, up from 35% in FY2024. This increase  
is attributable to GWA’s recycling efforts,  
with the additional recycling of obsolete metals. 
Table 3 presents key metrics for operational 
waste which was diverted from disposal.

ENERGY & 
EMISSIONS
GWA progressed its emissions strategy by 
integrating low-emission solutions across 
operations and product offerings. This included 
evaluating renewable energy supply, expanding 
the hybrid fleet, optimising local logistics, and 
partnering with international freight providers 
to explore rail transportation options to 
lower emissions. 
GWA’s approach is grounded in data-driven 
monitoring of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions, 
and laying the groundwork to review and 
consider Scope 3 emissions. These initiatives 
form part of GWA’s ESG Roadmap.
ENERGY 
Energy consumption from GWA’s business 
facilities spans across seven offices, three 
experience centres and six distribution centres. 
GWA continues to generate solar power from 
its distribution centres at Prestons, NSW and 
Pinkenba, QLD. 
The Prestons site, equipped with a 250kW 
solar panel system, saw a 6% decrease in solar 
generation in FY2025, producing 314,139kWh 
compared to 334,354kWh in F2024. In contrast, 
the Pinkenba site, with a 100kW system, 
generated 143,025kWh in FY2025, nearly 
doubling its output from 72,728kWh in FY2024. 
This solar initiative helped GWA avoid  
370 tonnes of CO₂ emissions in FY2025,  
up from 280 tonnes in FY2024. ANZ Packaging Material Efficiency
In FY25 GWA achieved a significant milestone in sustainable 
packaging. 94% of products now feature packaging — whether 
cardboard or plastic — that incorporates recycled content, reducing 
reliance on virgin materials. 
This progress underscores GWA’s commitment to minimising 
environmental impact by prioritising recycled and responsibly sourced 
inputs, without compromising packaging integrity or product safety.

GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS
In FY2025, GWA progressed its emissions 
reduction agenda. Operationally, GWA continues 
to pursue energy efficiency improvements 
and renewable energy integration to reduce 
Scope 1 and 2 emissions, and decrease reliance 
on grid electricity. The company successfully 
launched supply partner engagement programs 
to better understand upstream emissions and 
suppliers’ ESG priorities, laying the groundwork 
for Scope 3 emissions management in the 
future. GWA is receiving strong support from 
suppliers across the value chain, with rail freight 
providers being trialled in an effort to reduce 
Scope 3 emissions. 
Scope 1 emissions
Aligned with its efforts to reduce Scope 1 
emissions, GWA has expanded its transition to 
hybrid vehicles across Australia, New Zealand  
and the UK. 
Scope 1 emissions are presented in Table 4 below.

GWA expanded its vehicle fleet and accelerated 
its transition to hybrid models, increasing 
hybrid representation to 80% in FY2025, 
as detailed in Table 5. 
Plans are underway to roll out hybrid vehicles in 
New Zealand from September 2025 and in the 
United Kingdom from July 2025, aligned with 
lease renewals. Increased business activity and 
updated emission factor calculations led to an 
increase in Scope 1 emissions for FY2025.Table 5: Overview of global fleet transition

Scope 2 emissions
For the period ending 30 June 2025, GWA’s 
gross indirect emissions from operational  
energy consumption decreased to  
1,064 tonnes CO₂e, which was down from  
1,299 tonnes CO₂e in FY2024. 
The company is actively exploring further 
opportunities to reduce electricity-driven energy 
use and associated emissions across its facilities, 
particularly through the expanded adoption of 
solar power solutions. 
Scope 2 emissions are presented in 
Table 6 below.

Rail Transport
Rail freight produces 3.3x less carbon emissions 
than road freight per tonne-kilometre, making it 
a key alternative in Australia’s shift toward a  
net-zero transport network. *
At GWA, sustainability is not just a goal, it’s a 
commitment embedded in how products are 
moved across the country. Over the past year, 
GWA has taken steps to reduce emissions, by 
exploring targeted partnerships and innovations 
aimed at reducing the carbon from freight 
operations. GWA collaborated with three 
international freight providers and launched  
a rail freight trial in August 2024. This initiative 
successfully shifted 165 containers from Sydney 
Ports to the Prestons IDC, with an additional 
111 containers moved interstate through this 
alternative. These efforts have the potential to 
reduce CO₂ emissions for volume moved, while 
also reducing road congestion by removing 
trucks from urban routes**.
GWA’s low-emission freight initiative is a clear 
reflection of GWA’s strategic enablers of ESG and 
Innovation, driving commercial value through  
strong supply chain partnerships. The benefits 
it delivers, such as improved air quality and 
reduced urban congestion, underscore the 
broader societal value and environmental impact.

LOOKING 
FORWARD
GWA’s ESG roadmap proposes an 
environmental impact reduction strategy, 
addressing energy use and emissions. 
Following the work completed in FY2025, 
GWA plans to continue efforts in:
 •Emissions management, with a focus on 
deepening Scope 3 emissions visibility and 
aligning future reduction pathways.
 •Ongoing optimisation of operational 
processes, including automation, digital 
transformation and sustainable retail displays 
crafted from recyclable lightweight materials.
 •The proposed assessment of product lifecycle 
impacts to inform future sustainability 
decisions, including exploration of 
alternative materials to enable lighter, lower 
embodied carbon Vitreous China (VC) and 
metal products. 
 •Expanding rail freight utilisation to reduce 
supply chain environmental impact.
