Impact and innovation 
Greenhouse gas emissions 
We completed our third annual calculation of the Group’s 
GHG emissions in FY25, demonstrating our commitment to 
keeping our stakeholders informed of the Group’s carbon 
footprint. The nature and modest quantum of the Group’s 
emissions set out in the table below reflect the low‑emission 
nature of professional services businesses.
Our ongoing efforts to track our GHG emissions are essential for 
monitoring our environmental impact. The GHG emissions data 
set out in this report adheres to international standards such 
as the International Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHG Protocol), 
which is adopted by AASB S2, along with ISO 14064‑ 1 Standard 
for the reporting of GHG emissions and removals. 
During FY25, IPH:
 —formalised a basis of preparation, which provides clear 
guidance as to the methods of calculation, including 
appropriate emission factors, for the Group’s Scope 
1, 2 and applicable Scope 3 GHG emissions; 
 —established a boundary setting policy, by adopting 
the operational control method. Under this method, 
IPH accounts for 100% of its emissions from 
operations over which it, including its subsidiaries, 
has operational control, as Scope 1 emissions;
 —refined the methodology and conversion factors used 
for estimating and calculating GHG emissions; and
 —established more robust processes and controls to ensure 
data used to calculate emissions is complete and accurate.
The Group’s FY24 comparative GHG emissions data has been 
re‑presented to ensure consistency and comparability with 
our refined methodology.

1. Relevant categories in the Scope 3 Chart.Gross emissions have been estimated using a standardised 
approach based on activity data and emission factors. 
Activity data collected – such as fuel combustion, electricity 
usage, distance travelled, or dollars spent – were multiplied 
by relevant emission factors. Emissions factors are coefficients 
that estimate the amount of GHGs emitted per unit of activity. 
IPH has used publicly available emission factors published 
by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and 
Australian National Greenhouse Accounts Factors.
The increase in Group GHG emissions from FY24 to FY25 
is mainly attributed to the acquisition of the Bereskin & Parr 
business during FY25, and the full year impact of businesses 
acquired part year through FY24.
Scope 3 GHG emissions
Scope 3 GHG emissions represent indirect emissions 
arising from activities across our value chain that are not 
included in Scope 1 or Scope 2 and are the highest source 
of GHG emissions for the Group as a network of professional 
services businesses.

Group’s Scope 3 GHG emissions.
