C,limate and Nature Risks,,,
D,"uring  FY25,  Cuscal  engaged  external  sustainability  experts  to  identify  climate  and  nature-related  risks  to",,,
,"understand  and  manage  the  risks  and  opportunities  associated  with  the  natural  environment,  a  changing",,,
,climate and the transition to a low-carbon economy. This foundational work is part of Cuscal’s preparations,,,
,for the mandatory sustainability disclosures under the Australian Sustainability Reporting Standard AASB S2,,,
,Climate-related Disclosures.,,,
C,"uscal’s identified climate-related risks range from business interruptions due to extreme weather events, to",,,
,costs  associated  with  preparing  for  the  transition  to  a  low-carbon  economy  and  potential  decreases  in,,,
,revenues  in  climate-vulnerable  sectors  and  regions.  Several  of  these  are  indirect  risks  and  require  further,,,
,"assessment, including a scenario analysis, to fully understand their impact and materiality.",,,
G,iven  Cuscal’s  established  reliance  on  natural  capital  and  ecosystems  across  its  business  operations  and,,,
,"value chain, nature-related risks have been considered. Key dependencies include water, which is essential for",,,
,"data centre cooling, and sanitation and maintenance services in corporate offices. The Company is also aware",,,
,of  potential  lower  demand  for  Cuscal’s  products  and  services  in  sectors  and  regions  that  are  exposed  to,,,
environmental decline.,,,,
T,he outcome of this work will support a broader and comprehensive ESG and sustainability roadmap for FY26.,,,
F,Y25 Carbon Footprint,,,
C,uscal commissioned an independent consultant certified by Climate Active to comprehensively assess the,,,
,Group’s GHG emissions for FY25. The emissions boundary to be reported on for FY25 covers emissions from,,,
,"sources  owned  or  controlled  by  the  Group  (Scope  1),  and  emissions  from  the  generation  of  purchased",,,
,"electricity  consumed by the Group (Scope 2). In future years, the Group will expand its reporting to include",,,
,indirect  emissions  from  sources  not  owned  or  controlled  by  the  Group  but  that  occur  as  a  result  of  Group,,,
activities (Scope 3).,,,,
B,"ased on the best available data, the estimated total Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions for the Group in",,,
,FY25 was 234.42 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2-e).,,,

,assumptions.,,,
T,he Group had a 0.36 GHG intensity ratio for Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions per full-time equivalent (FTE) in,,,
,"FY25. This represents a slight increase from FY24 (0.34), predominantly due to a decrease in FTE numbers.",,,
T,he  Group’s  Scope  1  and  Scope  2  GHG  emissions  for  FY25  have  been  calculated  in  line  with  the  World,,,
,Resources Institute’s Greenhouse Gas Protocol Corporate Standard. The assessment has been completed in,,,
,"accordance with ISO14064, an international standard for GHG emissions accounting and reporting.",,,
