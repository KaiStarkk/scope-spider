Values:A WORD FROM  
OUR CEO
Pact’s Vision is to Lead the Circular Economy and we are 
committed to creating lasting value for the environment by 
reducing waste through our innovative packaging, contract 
manufacturing, reuse and recycling solutions.
Our FY24 Sustainability Report outlines our Environment, 
Social and Governance (ESG ) strategy, commitments,  
and impact assessments under three categories: People, 
Planet and Principles. These three pillars drive our purpose  
to ensure we:
• have a safe and respectful workplace with highly 
motivated and engaged talent;
• reduce our environmental impact and progress  
our 2025 End of Waste T argets ambitions; and 
• conduct our business responsibly and invest in  
programs that positively impact the communities  
in which we operate.
Highlights
We reached some significant milestones in FY24 towards 
achieving our sustainability goals.
Two new Pact-operated Circular Plastics Australia (CPA ) 
joint venture recycling facilities commenced operations  
in Victoria. The CPA (PET)1 recycling plant in Altona North  
can produce up to 20,000 tonnes per annum of food  
grade recycled PET resin and adds to the existing CPA  
(PET) recycling plant in Albury (NSW).
The CPA (PE)2 mixed plastics recycling plant in Laverton   
produces up to 20,000 tonnes per annum of recycled 
HDPE and PP resins from milk bottles, dairy containers, and 
household packaging collected from kerbside recycling bins.    
People
Safety remains the number one priority for our people.  
T o this end, in FY24 we transitioned away from  
     a corporate-led approach to WHSE  
             to a decentralised model. Our  
                 new One Pact WSHE Council   
    prioritises proactive risk  
   management and critical  
    control measures rather than  
      the traditional reactive  
      approach to safety.  We recorded improvements in our T otal Recordable Injuries 
close-out rate and Safety Behavioural Observations. 
In FY24, one of our objectives was to have 30% female 
representation in our Senior Leadership T eam and I am 
proud to report that we achieved that outcome. 
Planet
We continued to make progress towards achieving our  
2025 End of Waste T argets to:
•  Reduce: eliminate all problematic polymers we use  
for manufacturing packaging;
•  Reuse: have solutions to reduce, reuse and recycle all  
 single-use secondary packaging in retailers; and 
•  Recycle: offer an average of 30% recycled content  
across our packaging portfolio.
In FY24, we decreased consumption of problematic 
polymers used to manufacture packaging by 40%,  
or more than 1,200 tonnes compared to FY23. 
T o grow Pact’s Crate Pooling and Crate Manufacturing 
operations, we divested 50% of the business to form the 
Viscount Reuse joint venture3 in partnership with global 
infrastructure investment manager, Morrison & Co.  
The reusable and recyclable plastic packaging crates  
are a sustainable alternative to single use cardboard  
and polystyrene boxes and deliver economic and 
sustainability benefits across fresh grocery supply chains.
We increased consumption of recycled resin by 2,300 
tonnes. This equates to an average of 12% inclusion 
of recycled resin across our plastics portfolio. We also 
increased the amount of recycled plastic we processed  
and sold by almost 10% or more than 5,000 tonnes 
compared to FY23.
And we achieved a 9% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 
emissions across Australia and New Zealand, compared  
to FY23.
Principles
T o strengthen governance in FY24, the Group refreshed nine 
corporate policies and adopted two new internal policies.
As a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact 
(UNGC), we accept our role as a responsible employer 
and remain committed to supporting the Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDG ). Pact will continue to deliver 
against the SDG through our Circular Economy Strategy  
and this Report  describes our actions.
Thank you
Pact’s positive sustainability performance is not possible 
without our people and I am extremely proud of our talented 
and dedicated employees who continue to pursue our vision 
and embrace our values for the benefit of our Company and  
all our stakeholders.

ENERGY & 
EMISSIONS Scope 3 Emissions
Scope 1 & 2 Emissions Pact Group consumes several energy sources in our 
manufacturing processes. Electricity is the primary source of 
energy used to power our machines, motors and pumps. We also 
use natural gas to power ovens and boilers, and LPG for forklifts. 
As a standard business practice, all our sites work continuously 
to reduce the amount of energy consumed and implement site-
based efficiency programs.
Scope 1: 17,692  Scope 2: 222,536Globally, we report our greenhouse gas emissions and energy in accordance with the World Resources Institute 
(WRI) Greenhouse Gas Protocol and specifically in Australia we report our greenhouse gas emissions and energy use 
through the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Scheme. All our emissions globally are externally reviewed 
and assured to ensure the accuracy and completeness of data. In FY24 Pact Group consumed 1,746,968 gigajoules 
(GJ) of energy and emitted 240,228 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (tCO2e)8.
The breakdown of this result is as follows:
• Australian emission and energy content factors were derived from the National 
Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (Measurement) Determination 2008 as amended  
for 2023–2024. 
• New Zealand emission and energy content factors were derived from the Ministry for  
the Environment's Measuring emissions: A guide for organisations: 2024 detailed guide.
• Emissions factors for the rest of the world were obtained from other sources9.Energy and emissions

Scope 1 15,160 2,098 434 17,692
Scope 2 164,335 4,637 53,564 222,536Although reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions is crucial, 
the emissions across our value chain (Scope 3) are much 
greater. Understanding these Scope 3 emissions allows us 
to better manage our total emissions impact, which aligns 
with our commitment to sustainability and our Vision to 
Lead the Circular Economy. 
In FY23 Pact calculated its Scope 3 emissions for the  
first time, but was only able to include four of the 15 
categories. In FY24, a number of reporting improvements 
has allowed the Group to calculate our Scope 3 emissions 
with far greater accuracy than previously reported, 
and across 10 of the 15 categories that are material 
to Pact. Each category has been calculated following 
the methodologies in the Greenhouse Gas Protocol – Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Standard.  
For further details of the methods used please refer  
to the notes and assumptions page (page 73).
In FY24, Pact’s total Scope 3 emissions, in relation to the 
above categories was 851,442 tCO2e. Similar to most  
other companies involved in manufacturing, Pact’s largest 
source of Scope 3 emissions is the raw materials we use  
to produce packaging.
Using this more accurate Scope 3 calculation, in FY25,  
Pact will set a Scope 3 emission reduction target to 
complement our existing Emission Reduction T arget  
(ERT) and have these targets validated by the Science  
Based T arget Initiatives (SBTi ).
