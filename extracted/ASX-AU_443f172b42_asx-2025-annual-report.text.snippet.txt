Disclaimer
Due to the inherent uncertainty and limitations in measuring greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions and operational energy consumption, all GHG emissions and operational 
energy consumption data in this report are estimates. There may also be differences 
in the manner that third parties calculate or report GHG emissions or operational 
energy consumption data compared to ASX, which means third party data may not be 
comparable to ASX’s data. For information on how we calculate our GHG emissions 
and operational energy consumption data, refer to page 36.Materiality assessment
ASX has identified its important sustainability issues on the 
basis of ASX’s impact on stakeholders and society, and the 
impact of various topics and issues on ASX as a business. 
During 2024, an assessment of material topics was undertaken 
which has been used to anchor the focus areas in ASX’s 
sustainability framework. This assessment forms basis of our 
for focus areas for FY25.
Several inputs into the assessment have been considered 
including an aggregation of the material topics of approximately 
15 securities exchanges from around the world and a review of 
ASX-related commentary from stakeholders such as government 
and regulators.
Over 100 themes were identified by ASX and aggregated into 
10 material topics, with each ranked based on their importance 
to ASX as a business and importance to key stakeholder groups. 
The 10 material topics, agreed by the ASX Board, informed the 
development of ASX’s sustainability framework and form the 
basis of ASX’s sustainability reporting in FY25. 
Please refer to the 2024 Sustainability Report for a detailed 
description of the material topics. Sustainable pillars
ASX’s sustainability approach is delivered 
through two key pillars: 
Sustainable 
Development Goals
ASX’s approach to sustainability is 
aligned to the United Nation’s Sustainable 
Development Goals (SDGs) to directly link 
our impacts to the greater global efforts 
to end inequality, protect the planet, and 
add to prosperity for all. The actions we’re 
taking within our two sustainability pillars 
support seven of the SDGsASX’s Board and management are committed to the 
sustainability of ASX, as a critical enabler of achieving its vision 
to be the market’s choice, inspiring confidence and trust.
In 2024, ASX updated its sustainability framework to reflect 
the changing sustainability landscape, and ASX’s strategy and 
operating context. The enhanced framework incorporates the 
perspectives of a wide range of ASX’s stakeholders through a 
materiality analysis.
This report provides an overview of ASX’s sustainability 
framework, and the performance of key sustainability activities 
undertaken in FY25.

1. Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions for electricity consumed by ASX facilities are calculated and reported on a gross basis (excluding the purchase and surrender of offsets) using a market-based 
approach. Within this calculation an emission factor of zero is applied for: 
a. Mandatory grid renewables (for example through the large- scale renewable energy target (LRET) under the Renewable Energy Target Scheme of the Australian Government); 
b. Offsite and onsite renewables where Large-scale Generation Certificates (LGCs) have been retired directly or indirectly by third party providers of electricity or by jurisdictional 
governments over and above those required by the LRET (or equivalent);
c. Onsite renewables where LGCs are not generated; and 
d. Accredited GreenPower. An emission factor of zero is also applied for the calculation of market-based Scope 2 and 3 emissions where Climate Active certified carbon neutral electricity has 
been consumed. Where LGCs are generated and sold (not retired), this electricity is treated as non-renewable electricity with equivalent emissions factors as grid-supplied electricity.26ASX Limited | Sustainability report

Minimising our   
carbon impact
Addressing climate change
It is important that our response to climate change is aligned with our values as an organisation. 
While we do not believe ASX has material direct exposure from climate change, we strive to 
adhere to best practice and be an example for issuers.
As the premier securities and derivatives market operator in Australia, we seek to lead by 
example by supporting sustainability in our business and operations. We recognise we have 
a part to play in reducing carbon emissions, and have achieved net zero for our Scope 1 and 
Scope 2 emissions (Net zero Total Scope 1 and 2 emissions after purchase and surrender of 
offsets in FY25).1
Our approach to climate change focuses on what ASX can do to:
a. Minimise the impact of our operations on the environment and carbon footprint;
b. Encourage consistent, comparable, and reliable climate change-related reporting and 
disclosure (by offering issuer education); and
c. Support Australia’s transition to a lower carbon economy by offering products and 
services that enhance decision-making, manage risk and meet the growing demand for 
environmental, social and governance (ESG) investments.Climate Change 
Statement
Our approach to climate 
change brings together 
our commitment to being 
a responsible corporate 
citizen, our role in supporting 
Australia’s transition to a 
lower carbon economy, and 
our role as market operator, 
to encourage transparency 
from issuers.
ASX aims to deliver

Climate scenario analysis
In FY21, ASX completed climate scenario analysis to evaluate the exposure of our physical locations to climate hazards, and the possible 
impacts of climate-related transition risks on our business and strategy. While the analysis below reflects the outcomes of the FY21 exercise, 
the risks and opportunities identified remain aligned with our strategy and form the basis of our approach to sustainability.
Process for identification and assessment:
This scenario analysis will be revisited in FY26 as part of ASX’s transition to mandatory Sustainability Reporting under the Corporations Act.
Two separate time horizons guided our analysis. A shorter time horizon of 2030 was selected to capture those impacts arising from the policy, 
regulatory and economic changes in the business environment due to the transition to a lower carbon economy. A second time horizon of 2050 
was selected to assess the longer-term physical impacts from climate change, focusing particularly on ASX’s locations, physical assets and the 
indirect impacts from supply chain disruption due to changes in the climate.
Complementing this, two alternate scenarios were specifically developed for ASX to assess climate change risks and opportunities. They were 
developed with regard to the Task Force on Financial-Related Climate Disclosures (TCFD) requirements that scenario analysis be plausible, 
distinctive, consistent, relevant and challenging.
The scenarios utilised elements of two globally recognised climate reference frameworks. To assess ASX’s transition risks and opportunities, the 
Network for Greening the Financial System’s (NGFS) ‘Disorderly’ and ‘Hot House World’ scenarios were predominantly used. They were selected 
for their relevance to the financial services sector (in which ASX operates).
For the assessment of ASX’s physical risks, two of the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Representative Concentration Pathways  
(RCPs) were used: RCP 8.5 (High Emissions) and RCP 2.6 (Low Emissions).
The combination of the NGFS and IPCC reference frameworks generated two emissions pathways: a Low Emissions and a High Emissions pathway.
A range of physical and transition risks and opportunities were identified and validated by an external party who utilised desktop research and 
stakeholder feedback.
Climate scenarioApplication

High Emissions Hot House World 
(Current policies)RCP8.5 Business as usual approach to climate change; assuming continued 
growth in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, significant physical risks of 
climate change but potentially less prominent transition impacts. This 
scenario assumed no change in current government policies.
Low Emissions Disorderly  
(Immediate 1.5ºC 
with limited carbon 
dioxide removal)RCP2.6 Assumes no short-term action, but post 2030 global collaboration efforts 
then culminate in swift international policy response, resulting in GHG 
emissions reductions and behavioural change to support the transition 
to net zero.Minimising our carbon impact continued
