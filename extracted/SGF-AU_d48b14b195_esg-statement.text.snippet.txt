Environmental 
Policy  
Version 2.0 
SG Fleet Group Limited  
ABN 40 167 554 574With regard to the emission 
reduction objective, SG Fleet 
aims to reduce emission 
intensity, measured as tCO 2-e 
per Full-time Equivalent to 
take into account growth in 
the business, by 33% by the 
end of the 2030 financial year, 
with the 2023 financial period 
as the base year.
In November 2024, SG 
Fleet revised its Group 
Environmental Policy, adding 
a further emission reduction 
target. We now aim to achieve 
net zero greenhouse gas 
emissions group-wide by the 
end of the 2030 financial year. 
This net zero target applies to 
Scope 1 (direct) and 2 (indirect 
energy footprint) emissions. 
The execution of the Policy is 
independent of the company’s 
carbon neutrality status 
in its various geographies 
and the company will 
continuously explore options 
to further cut emissions and 
progressively reduce its 
reliance on carbon offsets 
to achieve carbon neutrality.To achieve these objectives, 
SG Fleet operates an 
environmental management 
system (‘EMS’), which is based 
on global and local standards, 
including ISO 14001:2015, 
and all applicable regulations 
and laws. 
The EMS is comprised 
of the Environmental 
Policy, the environmental 
component of the ESG Action 
Plan, the ESG Committee 
governance structure, and 
all associated monitoring, 
measurement, management, 
and reporting activities. 
The environmental 
component of the ESG 
Action Plan, referred to as 
the Emissions Reduction 
Action Plan, or E-RAP, 
lists environmental initiatives 
earmarked for execution 
or assessment during the 
period. The initiatives are 
grouped by the relevant 
risk, the corresponding 
emissions-producing activity, 
as well the scope under 
which these emissions fall. E-RAP focuses in particular 
on the areas identified as 
the main contributors to 
the company’s emissions 
total. As these areas are an 
integral part of the company’s 
day-to-day operations, the 
execution of the Environmental 
Policy and E-RAP, as well as 
the operation of the EMS, 
involve the implementation 
of adjustments to a range of 
ongoing business practices.Environment
SG Fleet ensures its day-to-day operations 
minimise resource consumption, waste, and 
emissions. In addition, we work with our 
customers, business partners, and suppliers 
to assist them with their environmental 
impact reduction initiatives.

Leading the way in cooperation with our stakeholders
We believe that we can create a positive environmental impact not 
only by reducing the company’s own footprint, but also by shaping and 
supporting behaviours with our various stakeholders. In addition to instilling 
environmentally sound practices in the workplace, we aim to provide our 
people with information on how to contribute to a more sustainable future in 
every walk of life. The same objective is also the foundation of the work we do 
with our customers to support their organisational sustainability objectives.
In the 2025 financial year, 
SG Fleet was again able 
to assist customers by 
utilising its recognised low 
and zero-emission transport 
expertise. EV Drive Days 
continued to be a very 
successful method of raising 
awareness and understanding 
of alternative engine 
technology and sustainable 
mobility solutions. In total, SG 
Fleet hosted four Drive Days 
during the year, partnering with 
suppliers and manufacturers 
to showcase passenger and 
light commercial EV vehicles 
to our customers. 
In September 2024, 
we celebrated the 
5th annual World EV Day 
and the continuing shift 
towards a cleaner, greener 
future. SG Fleet is proud 
to play an important role 
in this journey, supporting 
customers via our eStart 
EV transitioning consulting 
service. This includes 
assistance with the set-up 
of charging infrastructure 
as well as the management 
of charging costs. During the year, we 
successfully piloted 
a corporate charging 
solution, based on a 
charge-as-a-service model, 
for one of our largest 
customers. We continued 
to onboard additional public 
charging providers and 
introduced ‘electricity as a fuel’ 
reimbursement arrangements 
for novated drivers.
The future is multi-modal, 
and our solutions are not 
limited to traditional vehicle 
types. The functionality of 
alternative modes of transport 
is increasingly recognised 
in the personal and delivery 
transport space, with 
consumers and companies 
exploring micro-mobility as 
an environmentally friendly, 
viable alternative. SG Fleet’s 
cooperation with eMobility 
provider Zoomo offers 
customers additional options 
to improve the efficiency of 
their fleets, both in terms of 
flexibility and sustainability.4

SG Fleet’s contribution to 
a better transport future 
isn’t limited to its day-to-day 
services. We also actively 
collaborate with industry 
bodies and organisations 
across all of our geographies 
to support research, inform, 
foster debate, and break 
down barriers. In Australia, the company 
is an active member of the 
Electric Vehicle Council and the 
Australian Hydrogen Council, 
and was a significant 
contributor to the REVS 
vehicle-to-grid project, 
which successfully trialled 
the transfer of EV battery 
energy into the electricity 
grid. In New Zealand, 
we are members of 
Drive Electric NZ and the 
Sustainable Business Council. 
Greenfleet
In early 2025, SG Fleet received its Greenfleet 
Impact Certificate for the preceding year. 
Our Australian operations were one of around 
600 organisations leading the way in the fight 
against climate change. Nearly 550 hectares were 
revegetated, including 460 hectares of protected 
koala habitat. The area will remove close to 750,000 
tonnes of carbon from the environment, the 
equivalent of one year of emissions from around 
175,000 cars.
Future Focus 
With the advent of the Australian Sustainability 
Reporting Standards (ASRS), SG Fleet will 
increasingly be assisting customers with the 
calculation of fleet-related emissions. This is 
likely to raise awareness of the scope of these 
emissions and promote initiatives to reduce 
associated impacts. We will be in a strong position 
to make a difference in this regard by supporting 
our customers’ environmental objectives and by 
participating in their sustainability efforts.
Internally, we will also continue to review the 
environmental performance of our premises with 
landlords and promote environmental awareness 
among our people. Consideration is currently being 
given to an initiative, together with neighbouring 
businesses, to organise clean-ups of the areas 
around our premises.

The main contributors to our 
emissions equivalent total are 
IT equipment and services, 
electricity consumption 
(see below), staff commuting, 
and to a lesser extent, waste 
(see below), direct emissions 
from our own fleet, and 
air travel. We continuously 
explore options to further cut 
emissions across Scope 1 
and 2 and, where under the 
company’s control, Scope 3, 
with a particular focus on 
these main contributors.
Where possible, we move 
IT-related equipment and 
services off premises towards 
more sustainable solutions. 
This reduces their emissions 
equivalent impact. We also 
source equipment that 
includes offsets as part of the 
purchasing or leasing contract.SG Fleet has actively targeted 
emissions produced by staff 
commuting and business 
travel for a number of years, 
offering arrangements and 
facilities that will reduce 
fuel consumption overall. 
This included carpooling 
clubs, the availability of eBikes, 
and the installation of bicycle 
storage sheds at our offices. 
In the 2024 financial year, 
we introduced shuttle buses 
at the company’s head office. 
The buses ferry staff back and 
forth between our premises 
and the nearest train stations, 
encouraging our people to use 
public transport rather than 
commuting individually by car. 
2025 marks the first full year 
this shuttle service has been 
operational.In Australia, the rate of 
transition of SG Fleet’s own 
fleet to low and zero-emission 
vehicles accelerated 
again during the period, 
increasing from 10% at the 
end of the 2022 financial 
year to 80% at the end of 
the 2025 financial year. 
About one-third of our internal 
fleet is now fully electric. 
Use of our on-premises 
EV chargers continues 
to increase, reflecting the 
growing proportion of EVs 
in our own fleet and amongst 
our staff. The company will 
continue to move towards 
a larger proportion of 
low- or zero-emission vehicles 
in its own fleet in order to 
achieve its net zero ambitions.The Australian operations 
of SG Fleet have obtained 
a yearly ClimateActive 
certification as a carbon 
neutral organisation since the 
2022 financial year. SG Fleet’s 
UK operations achieved 
carbon neutrality for the first 
time early in the 2023 financial 
year. In the 2024 financial year, 
our New Zealand operations 
obtained the same status, 
making the entire SG Fleet 
Group carbon neutral for 
the full 2025 financial period.Emissions
SG Fleet measures its emissions footprint both as direct CO2 emissions and 
as the emissions equivalents associated with a range of business or support 
activities. As an office-based services company, SG Fleet does not directly 
produce meaningful levels of CO2 in its day-to-day business operations. 
We only operate a small internal fleet of vehicles, and the provision of our 
services does not generally require significant travel or transport.

We also actively encourage 
our people to be mindful of 
the energy consumed by office 
equipment and utilities. In the 
2025 financial year, a staff 
environmental e-learning 
module was introduced, which 
includes additional tips to 
minimise energy consumption 
wherever possible by actively 
reducing the use of appliances, 
lighting, and air-conditioning. 
At the end of the period, 
LED lighting and Green Energy 
arrangements were in place 
for all offices where we have 
direct control over lighting 
and energy set-ups. Our UK operations 
are participating in the 
government’s Energy 
Savings Opportunity 
Scheme (ESOS), a mandatory 
energy assessment 
scheme administrated by 
the Environment Agency. 
The assessment consists of 
an audit of the energy used 
by our buildings and business 
operations and is designed 
to identify measures to save 
energy and achieve carbon 
and cost savings.Energy Consumption
SG Fleet’s energy consumption is largely limited 
to the operation of its office and warehouse 
locations, including lighting, power sources, 
and heating. Where corresponding arrangements 
change or energy consuming equipment is 
replaced, the company investigates the feasibility 
of introducing more energy-efficient alternatives. 
Future Focus 
SG Fleet aims to lower its energy intensity ratio by putting 
in place additional initiatives to reduce overall energy 
consumption, including the adoption of ‘smart working’ 
set-ups and sensor/timed lighting and air conditioning 
systems. Any future fit-outs will incorporate this approach. 
Where possible, the company also continues to explore 
further opportunities with its landlords to improve the 
sustainability of its offices. Learnings from the UK 
ESOS scheme will be applied wherever possible at our 
other locations.
In 2026, the completion of the LeasePlan business 
integration will allow SG Fleet to reduce the total IT 
infrastructure required to support its Australian operations. 
Together with the adoption of alternative ways to host 
some applications, this will reduce overall energy usage 
and equipment requirements. Future Focus 
As SG Fleet continues to grow, IT services use, 
energy consumption, the number of staff commuting, 
and business travel are at risk of increasing as 
well. We will counter a corresponding escalation 
in emissions via a more efficient use of resources, 
in the process reducing emission intensity per 
full-time equivalent employee. 
In 2026, we will look to further harmonise systems 
onto cloud-based platforms, allowing us to 
decommission hardware and reduce the number 
of data centres required. Various business activities 
are also being analysed to determine whether we 
can reduce transport requirements and the use of 
consumables, for example by conducting remote 
interviewing and paperless onboarding in our 
recruitment process.7
