With Our Planet goals we continue our work to focus 
on our scope 1 and scope 2 emissions and the use of 
renewable energy. In the year ahead, we will review our 
goals to ensure they are appropriately structured to 
address relevant risks, capitalise on opportunities and 
reduce our environmental impact. 
FY2025 has been a significant year in our efforts around 
product stewardship. We commenced a trial across some 
of our Melbourne stores to provide a take back service 
for end-of-life children’s car seats. Our target was the 
return and processing of around 12 tonnes of car seats. As 
around 80% of a car seat (by weight) can be diverted from 
landfill, we believe this is an important first step in assisting 
to develop a solution for the industry. 
Baby Bunting has funded the operation of the program 
and the recycling costs. We have trialled different prices 
for this service, to measure changes in customers’ ability 
to partially contribute to the cost of the service. This 
has provided useful insights into how a retailer operated 
program might be structured on a larger scale. At the end 
of FY2025, we have expanded this trial to include all of 
our Melbourne stores and we have extended the trial for a 
further 6 months. We will make an assessment about the 
ongoing operation of the scheme in the future.In FY2026, we will continue our focus on preparing for 
the new Australian Sustainability Reporting Standards 
(AASB S2) that will apply to Baby Bunting for this coming 
financial year. As part of this, we are taking the opportunity 
to assess our current reporting and also the goals and 
objectives we wish to set in terms of climate- related 
matters and risks as they may affect Baby Bunting.
Looking ahead, we are committed to further improving 
our operations to contribute to sustainable outcomes and 
support our three sustainability pillars. I would like to thank 
our team members, suppliers, and other partners for their 
efforts throughout the year. In these challenging times, I  
am grateful to the Baby Bunting team for their unwavering 
focus on making our operations more sustainable.

that in the period 2021 to 2030 we 
have raised at least $10 million to assist 
parents in need and their children.In FY2025, we contributed around 
$715,000 to support the communities 
in which we work (up from $650,000 in 
FY2024).
We raised $414,000 to support Life’s 
Little Treasures Foundation and a 
further $214,000 to support PANDA. 
We also made contributions of 
$50,000 to Our Village.
We provided around $36,000 of 
in-kind support that helped a number 
of parents in need and organisations 
that support them.Our cumulative 
total during the 
2021-2025 period

Product 
stewardship:
Net zero scope 1 
and 2 greenhouse 
gas emissions by 
2050.Product stewardship schemes seek to 
ensure the responsible treatment of 
products at the end of their life, by the 
recycling and appropriate disposal of 
products.
Baby hard goods – eg car seats, 
prams and cots – are designed to 
provide safety and protection for 
young children and are made with hard 
durable materials. Developing product 
stewardship schemes will ensure that 
the components of these products 
can be reused or recycled in a manner 
that ensures as small an impact as 
possible once the goods have reached 
the end of their useful life.We commenced a trial in our Melbourne 
stores to provide a take-back service 
for end-of-life car seats. During the 
year, we collected and processed 2.45 
tonnes of used seats, with plastics, 
metals and fabrics recovered and 
directed to other uses and away from 
landfill. 
In New Zealand, we participate in the 
product stewardship scheme known 
as SeatSmart. Consumers are able to 
return end-of-life car seats at stores 
for processing to ensure as much as 
possible of the seat is diverted from 
landfill and able to be recycled.Improved

As Australia’s largest specialty 
maternity and baby goods 
retailer, we have a part to 
play in ensuring our impact 
on the community and the 
environment is as positive as 
it can be.
We aim to reduce our environmental footprint, particularly 
our energy use, waste and plastic packaging.
Energy use
Reducing the energy intensity of 
our operations
For a large format retailer like Baby Bunting, one of our 
largest potential environmental impacts is energy use 
and emissions.
We have taken steps over the last few years to reduce 
the energy usage of our store operations by installing 
energy efficient lighting, introducing features designed 
to efficiently use heating and cooling systems and to 
conserve power usage.
Our largest site is our Distribution Centre and Store 
Support Centre located in Dandenong South, Victoria 
which was commissioned in May 2021. These buildings 
have a 5-star energy rating along with solar panels that 
support electrical charging stations for our fleet of reach 
trucks and manual handling vehicles. There are also 
electric vehicle charging stations made available for our 
team members in order to support their use of their own 
electric vehicles to travel to work.
We are working towards sourcing all of our controllable 
electricity requirements from renewable sources by 2031. 
We obtain around 18.5% of our electricity requirements 
from renewable sources. Electricity costs are a significant 
cost for the business, but we will be working to expand our 
use of electricity from renewable sources in future years.Baby Bunting wants to play its part in working towards 
appropriate climate action. We aim to reduce energy 
consumption through making and choosing energy 
efficient upgrades (in stores and in our Distribution Centre), 
transitioning towards a greater percentage of renewable 
energy and through behavioural change.
There are three types of carbon emissions:
• Scope 1, resulting from burning fuel, like coal and gas. 
We generate almost no Scope 1 emissions;
• Scope 2, emissions generated through the grid 
electricity we purchase; and
• Scope 3, upstream emissions from suppliers providing 
services and making and transporting our products, and 
downstream emissions caused by customers using and 
disposing of our products.
Our energy use and emissions for FY2025 were as set out 
below.
Energy consumption
Energy consumed across our business, all sources (grid 
electricity, gas and petrol in vehicles): GJ 38,854 (FY2024: 
37 ,721 GJ).
Utilisation was: 77 .9% (FY2024: 76.4%) from grid electricity, 
18.5% from green energy (FY2024: 19.0%), 3.1% (FY2024: 
3.8%) from petrol and 0.6% (FY2024: 0.6%) from gas use 
(one store).
During FY2025, the number of Australian stores 
increased by one to 71 stores (two new stores with one 
store closure in the period). The number of New Zealand 
stores remained constant at four stores during FY2024, 
taking the total number of stores in the network to 75. 
The increases in energy consumed and the changes in 
utilisation are reflective of the four new stores opened in 
FY2024 and the additional stores opened in FY2025.
Looking at electricity consumed across the Group, the 
total consumed was 37 ,441 kJ (estimate). 80.9% of this 
electricity was grid electricity, with 19.1% being renewable 
sourced green energy. In FY2024, the proportion sourced 
from green energy was 19.0%.

Emissions
Our estimated carbon emissions in Australia and New 
Zealand during FY2025 were as follows:
• Scope 1: 99 tonnes (FY2024: 119 tonnes) CO₂e
• Scope 2: 6,771 tonnes (FY2024: 6,728) tonnes CO₂e
• Scope 3: No figures are available for scope 3 at this time.
In preparing the above calculations, it is noted that:
• any contractual arrangements entered into for the 
purchase of renewable energy have been excluded. 
Consequently, scope 2 emissions have been restated 
for FY2022-FY2024 and represents electricity the 
Group physically consumes through the operations of its 
stores, warehouse and support office locations. Green 
power has been added to the Group’s energy mix since 
FY2022; 
• electricity consumption has been estimated for 11 stores 
based on electricity consumed in similar sized stores 
in comparable locations. This estimate relates to 14% 
of the total electricity consumed from the grid and is 
included in the scope 2 emissions calculations;
• we have made some estimates in relation to refrigerant 
use in the air-conditioning systems of our stores; and
• emissions relating to third party operated logistics 
warehouses have been excluded. 
The vast majority of our emissions come from grid 
electricity used in our stores, Store Support Centre 
and Distribution Centre, and our calculations of these 
emissions have been based on electricity consumed 
(except as noted above).

We are working to prepare for the new reporting 
requirement to make climate-related financial disclosures 
in accordance with Australian Sustainability Reporting 
Standards (AASB S2). These are first expected to apply to 
Baby Bunting in relation to FY2026.
During the year, we have undertaken a gap assessment 
and have been focused on planning to ensure our 
reporting in FY2026 complies with the new requirements. 
Among other things, we have plans for Board and 
management strategy sessions during the year to consider 
and assess the climate-related risks and opportunities for 
Baby Bunting as well as appropriate scenario planning. 
Product stewardship
Supporting and expanding product 
stewardship initiatives
Everyone who imports, designs, produces and sells 
products, and everyone who uses and disposes of 
products, has a shared responsibility to reduce the impact 
on the environment, human health and safety of those 
products. Product stewardship involves the safe and 
environmentally sound management of products and 
materials over their lifetime, including at the end of their 
useful life.
Baby Bunting believes that it has a major role to play in the 
circular economy in helping to reduce the environmental 
impact of its products and packaging, with a particular 
emphasis on ‘reduce/reuse/recycle’. In support of this, 
we are conducting a car seat recycling trial in selected 
Melbourne stores and participate in the Seat Smart 
recycling scheme in New Zealand.
Product stewardship schemes
We have adopted a goal of having product stewardship 
schemes in place covering our hard goods category by 
2030. In respect of the recycling of car seats, refer to 
the below.
Hard goods include bulky items such as prams and 
strollers, car seats and capsules, cots and furniture as 
well as high chairs. For safety reasons, these products 
are usually produced using a combination of hard 
durable plastics, metals and in some cases wood.
We remain committed to participate in product 
stewardship schemes for products in the hard goods 
category, but we acknowledge the challenges we are 
facing as we aim to tackle this by way of collaborative 
supplier engagement, having regard to the costs involved 
in making these schemes work.
