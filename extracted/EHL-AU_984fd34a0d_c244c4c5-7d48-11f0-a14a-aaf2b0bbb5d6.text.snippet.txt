EMECO HOLDINGS LIMITED ANNUAL REPORT 202510
Capital Management
Emeco continues to maintain a prudent and balanced 
approach to capital management, prioritising 
business sustainability and shareholder value. Strong 
free cash flow generation in FY25 enabled us to fund 
essential fleet maintenance and further reduce debt.  
EBITDA to cash flow conversion was high at 97%, with 
prudent credit management continuing to drive 
consistent cash collections. 
We exercised strict capital expenditure discipline, 
sustaining capex for the year was $149 million (largely 
in line with depreciation). Growth capex was nil for 
FY25, as the business focused on maintaining high 
utilisation levels of its existing fleet. This disciplined 
approach helped drive stronger cash generation and 
allowed us to direct surplus cash to debt reduction. I 
am pleased to report that net debt was reduced from 
$281 million in FY24 to $195 million at the end of the 
reporting period, bringing our leverage ratio to 0.65x, 
well below our long-term target of 1.0x. 
The Group’s capital management programme was 
suspended in favour of debt reduction, placing the 
Company in a strong position ahead of its future 
refinancing.  Consequently, no interim or final 
dividend was declared for FY24 and FY25. Lower 
leverage provides the Company with  greater 
flexibility to consider growth opportunities and 
capital management options in the future, as well as 
providing increased resilience through mining cycles.  
Looking ahead, with leverage now at a very 
conservative level and strong liquidity, the Board 
will remain disciplined in balancing business 
reinvestment, with returning capital to shareholders 
in line with our capital management policy.  With 
strong cash generation expected to continue, further 
deleveraging of the balance sheet will also be 
considered. Strategy
During FY25, we continued to execute our strategy of 
business simplification and operational excellence. 
This simplification allows us to focus on what we do 
best: owning, rebuilding and maintaining mid-life 
mining equipment and providing world-class rental 
and maintenance services. By exiting lower-margin 
contract mining services, Emeco can now deploy all 
capital and management attention to the rental and 
asset services model that delivers superior margins 
and returns. Our mid-life asset rebuild capability, 
supported by our national workshop network and 
asset management technology gives us a cost and 
quality advantage that differentiates us from our 
competitors. 
We also made significant progress on key internal 
initiatives.  During the year, Emeco continued to 
progress the upgrade of its Enterprise Resource 
Planning (ERP) tool, which will modernise and 
integrate our core systems.  This will further drive 
efficiency and effectiveness through the Group into 
FY26 and beyond.
In parallel, we continued to roll out the Emeco 
Operating System (EOS), our proprietary fleet 
telemetry and performance technology. This 
technology gives our customers real-time insights 
to improve fleet productivity, enhance safety, and 
even reduce carbon emissions on their projects. 
EOS, combined with our asset health monitoring and 
analytics capabilities, is a differentiator for Emeco 
and exemplifies how we leverage innovation to add 
value for our customers and operate more efficiently. 
All these strategic initiatives from portfolio 
simplification to digital transformation are geared 
towards driving sustainable earnings, free cash flow, 
and achieving our long-term goal of a 20% return  
on capital.CHAIRMAN’S REPORT

Sustainability (ESG)
Emeco’s commitment to Environmental, Social, 
and Governance (ESG) excellence was further 
demonstrated in FY25. We have built on the 
groundwork laid last year in understanding and 
managing our carbon footprint. Following the Board’s 
approval of Emeco’s inaugural ESG strategy, we 
commenced tracking of the Company’s Scope 1 and 
Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions. We developed 
a baseline of our direct emissions (mostly from 
diesel used in our light vehicles and equipment) 
and electricity usage, and this year we have refined 
our data collection and methodology to improve 
accuracy. Work is also underway to assess our Scope 
3 emissions, such as the emissions from the operation 
of the heavy equipment we rent to clients and also 
from our supply chain. Our goal is to use these insights 
to chart a carbon reduction roadmap for Emeco. 
We recognise that our mid-life asset model inherently 
supports sustainability. By rebuilding and reusing 
heavy equipment, we extend asset life and reduce 
the need for new manufacturing, thereby contributing 
to a circular economy and lower lifecycle emissions. 
Additionally, our technology solutions like EOS help 
customers optimise fuel efficiency and reduce on-site 
emissions. We will continue to invest in innovations 
that will make our fleet and operations more carbon-
efficient and environmentally friendly. 
Emeco made meaningful strides in terms of its 
social and governance commitments. We sustained 
significant investment in our people through training 
and development programs focused on health, 
safety, wellbeing, and upskilling of our workforce. This 
not only improves our operational performance but 
also reinforces a culture where employees feel valued 
and empowered to develop their careers with Emeco. 
We modestly improved our workforce diversity and 
remain committed to fostering an inclusive workplace. 
Women now represent 12% of Emeco’s workforce and 
First Nations employees 4%, as we continue efforts 
to increase these numbers in line with our diversity 
goals. 
Finally, from a governance perspective, we uphold 
rigorous standards of corporate governance, risk 
management, and ethical conduct across the 
Group. Emeco’s Board and management are aligned 
in maintaining transparency and accountability, 
which underpins the trust of our shareholders, 
customers, employees, and the communities we 
serve. In everything we do, Emeco strives to create 
a sustainable enterprise that delivers innovative 
solutions for our customers, a “family” feel and safe 
environment for our people, support for our local 
communities, and attractive returns for our investors. 
We believe that by living our values and focusing on 
long-term, sustainable outcomes, we will continue to 
generate value for all stakeholders.Looking Ahead
In December 2024, I was formally appointed as 
Chairman following Peter Frank’s term as Interim 
Chair. I extend my gratitude to Peter for his stewardship 
during a pivotal period in Emeco’s transformation. 
As we look ahead, I am confident that Emeco is well 
positioned to sustain its positive momentum into 
FY26 and beyond. The mining sector outlook remains 
robust, and with our leaner cost base, reduced debt 
levels, and high-quality fleet, Emeco can leverage 
emerging opportunities to grow earnings further. 
We will maintain our disciplined approach by 
exercising prudence in capital allocation, focusing 
on customer service and asset productivity, and 
innovating through technology to ensure we deliver 
durable returns through the cycle. The Board and 
I have great confidence that under the continued 
leadership of our Managing Director and CEO,  
Ian Testrow, Emeco will continue to execute its strategy 
and pursue sustainable growth for the benefit of all 
shareholders. 
I would like to take this opportunity to thank Ian and 
the entire executive management team for their 
dedication and leadership in driving operational 
improvements, cost efficiencies, and strategic 
initiatives which have been instrumental to Emeco’s 
performance. 
I also extend my sincere appreciation to our 
employees across Australia, your hard work, 
expertise, and commitment to Emeco’s values are 
the foundation of our success. We also acknowledge 
our customers, key suppliers, business partners, and 
financiers for their support and partnership in FY25. 
To my fellow Board members, thank you for your 
guidance and support throughout the year as we have 
pursued Emeco’s strategic goals. Finally, and most 
importantly, I want to thank you, our shareholders, for 
your continued trust and support.
