Fortescue advocates for businesses to adopt a “Real Zero” approach to reducing 
their emissions instead of “Net Zero”. Put simply, this means eliminating the 
use of fossil fuels and not relying on offsets (unless required to do so by law), or 
carbon capture and storage.hemA tite

The story of the past 12 months is one of trends proven wrong.
We were told the world had moved on 
from recognising the existential threat 
of climate change. That the era of 
investing in green energy was drawing 
to a close. That ambition was out of 
fashion.
But here we are, with those with 
courage staying the course on 
climate, an Australian Government 
pushing to host a momentous global 
climate summit, and the global 
maritime sector on the brink of 
committing to an irreversible path 
to decarbonisation centred around 
– wait for it – green hydrogen with 
ammonia as its vector.mess Age From  
the executive  
chAirmAN
Sylvia Earle marvelled while onboard 
the Green Pioneer: “Here we are, with a 
solution to one of the biggest issues of 
our time”.
As the Green Pioneer has visited the 
world’s ports advocating for shipping’s 
accelerated transition to green fuels, 
it has embodied the innovative spirit, 
courage and determination that is 
taking Fortescue to Real Zero by 2030.
I think of our innovations – in green 
iron, in solar energy, in batteries. They 
are showing that those who try to undo 
global progress are simply choosing 
to lose the global technology race. 
Choosing to keep burning sticks and 
logs while the rest of the world moves 
forward.
The shift to green iron and to green 
steel isn’t optional – it’s a necessity. The 
global steel industry is responsible for 
nine per cent of global CO2 emissions, 
with iron making responsible for more 
than 90 per cent of that.
For the future of our planet, this must 
stop. But green iron also presents an 
unprecedented opportunity to secure 
the future of the Pilbara and fuel 
Australia’s economy for decades.
Our 1,500tpa Green Metal Project at 
Christmas Creek will soon be up and 
running, marking the first step on 
a journey that will revolutionise our 
mining operations.
Moving Western Australia from being 
a producer of iron ore to a producer 
of green iron that can be used to 
make green steel is a legacy we are 
determined to leave for all Australians.

Fortescue continues to point the way 
toward a zero-emissions economic 
future, and we are supporting global 
leaders in the shift we so desperately 
need for the survival of organic life.
I think of the Fortescue Green Pioneer. 
A single ship, helping to inspire the 
most ambitious emissions reduction 
rules ever agreed multilaterally, 
through the International Maritime 
Organization. It proved the naysayers 
wrong.

overviewFORTESCUE  FY25 ANNUAL REPORT    |    6ANdrew F orrest  Advancements in renewable energy 
technologies, such as solar and wind 
power with battery storage, mean we 
can convert intermittent renewables to 
reliable, 24/7 baseload green power.
When Fortescue decarbonises its 
operations, which will include the 
installation of more than 4GWh of 
battery energy storage within an 
integrated power network, we will  
set an example for the rest of the  
world to follow.
We continue to work with some of the 
world’s most innovative companies 
on battery intelligence systems and 
battery cell technology that will help 
us deliver some of the lowest cost 
energy in the world.
Green hydrogen remains critical to  
our future. Its day is coming, and we 
will be able to switch on as much 
energy as we need without harming 
the planet and without making 
despots who invade other countries 
using energy as a weapon, richer. Fortescue is in the process of proving 
24/7 baseload power as I write. 
Further, when the cost of producing 
green hydrogen inevitably reaches 
parity with fossil fuels, Fortescue will 
be ready.
Others are joining us on the path to 
Real Zero. IKEA and Lendlease, two 
admired global organisations, have 
been recognised alongside Fortescue 
for their pioneering, industry-leading 
climate strategies that phase out 
fossil fuels without reliance on carbon 
offsets.
I am optimistic about the future, not 
just because the world will catch on 
that continuing to burn anything we 
can is completely archaic when we 
can create all the energy we want, control it exactly as we need to with 
AI and deliver a green, peaceful 
world through nothing but finally 
tapping into infinite renewable energy. 
Confidence in this future comes not 
from this fact – we will all know this 
soon enough – but because of the 
men and women of Fortescue who are 
continuing to pioneer that future into 
reality.
Our people have put their hearts and 
minds into finding solutions. 
No new industry or transformational 
shift has ever been linear – or easy. 
We haven’t always got it right, but we 
learn every day from advances and 
setbacks. 
We are laser focused on leveraging 
our innovations to ensure operational 
excellence and we continue to push for 
solutions and growth in a disciplined 
manner.
Guided by the Values that have 
defined this great Company for more 
than two decades, it is my Fortescue 
family – the thousands of people who 
continue to give their all to get the job 
done – who inspire me.
While it is difficult to escape the 
sense that we live in an increasingly 
uncertain world, I remain certain of 
this: Australia can continue to lead the 
emissions free industrial capability 
that every child, woman and man 
deserves. gus pichot

FORTESCUE  FY25 ANNUAL REPORT    |    7Since our first shipment in 2008, Fortescue has never stood still.  
We have built a world-leading iron ore business by challenging the status 
quo and showing that ambition - backed by execution - delivers results.
FY25 was no exception. It was a year 
of operational excellence, big strides 
on decarbonisation, and a clear focus 
on keeping our people safe. 
Safety is at the heart of everything 
we do, and this year’s results reflect 
the focus and dedication our people 
bring to work every day. We recorded 
a T otal Recordable Injury Frequency 
Rate (TRIFR) of 1.3, a testament to the 
strength of our safety culture and the 
commitment of our team.  
Our iron ore business continues to  
be the engine room of Fortescue. In 
FY25, we shipped a record 198.4Mt, 
despite facing major challenges like 
severe weather. That outcome speaks 
to the resilience of our supply chain 
and the drive of our operations team. 
A Hematite C1 cost of US$17.99/wmt 
underscores our focus on operating 
excellence. We are delivering results 
today while setting ourselves up for 
the future.
With a strong foundation in place, 
we’re now bringing that same 
determination to the next frontier – 
leading the green industrial revolution.  A mess Age  
From our ceos
driviNg the greeN 
iNdustriAl revolutioN 
Climate change is not a distant 
threat. The world is on borrowed 
time and every delay in cutting fossil 
fuels pushes us closer to irreversible 
damage. Fortescue is not waiting for 
change. We are making it happen.  
Our answer is Real Zero – eliminating 
emissions at the source without 
carbon offsets. Across our Australian 
terrestrial iron ore operations, we 
are tuning off diesel, replacing it 
with renewable energy and green 
technology.  Fortescue Zero is 
powering that journey, developing 
innovative green technologies to help 
us decarbonise at speed and scale.  
Already, we have seven electric 
excavators in operation and our 
first electric drill is up and running.
We’re also building the backbone 
of our renewable energy future with 
460km of high voltage transmission 
lines constructed to date, linking our 
operations with renewable generation.   
At Cloudbreak, a 190MW solar farm is 
under construction, while our 100MW 
solar installation at North Star Junction 
is already supplying around 25 per 
cent of Iron Bridge’s power demand.  
T echnology is driving every aspect of 
our transition. Elysia, our advanced 
battery intelligence platform, is 
giving us deeper insights into battery 
performance and optimisation. We 
also see enormous opportunity in 
artificial intelligence to supercharge 
innovation, support smarter decision 
making and streamline operations 
across the business.

oF the pilb ArA 
As we decarbonise how we operate, 
we’re equally focused on transforming 
what we produce. And nowhere is that 
transformation more critical than in 
the steel supply chain. 
The Pilbara is not just where we 
operate. It’s our home, our legacy and 
the heart of everything we’ve built. Its 
future depends on innovation and we 
see green iron as key to ensuring the 
region remains globally competitive 
for generations to come.  
We are investing with conviction and 
our Green Metal Project at Christmas 
Creek is proof of that. It marks a 
major step forward in our ambition to 
produce green metal commercially in 
Western Australia.   
We are also deepening our R&D efforts 
in green ironmaking technologies, 
knowing that breakthroughs here 
could unlock significant emissions 
reductions across the global supply 
chain.  evol viNg our greeN

This year, we refined our global energy 
portfolio, sharpening our focus on 
projects that are economically viable 
and strategically aligned. Financial 
discipline remains a cornerstone of 
our approach. 
We remain confident in the long-term 
opportunity in green hydrogen, and 
see it as a key enabler for green iron in 
the near term. While the market is still 
forming, we are building the capability 
and technology now, so we’re ready to 
lead when demand scales.  
Our decisions today are focused 
on long-term value creation for 
shareholders, ensuring we invest 
where Fortescue’s expertise and 
innovation can deliver commercial 
returns. positioNed F or growth 
Fortescue is in excellent shape – 
strong, agile and future-focused. Amid 
geopolitical uncertainty, we remain 
focused on what we can control: 
safety, innovation, financial strength 
and leading the transition to Real Zero.  
This year has shown that when 
ambition meets action, extraordinary 
things are possible. 
At the heart of our success are 
our people. T o our 16,000-strong
